<h2>SERMON I. - DISCIPLINE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(<i>Preached at the Volunteer Camp, Wimbledon, July</i> 14, 1867.)</p>
<p>NUMBERS xxiv. 9.</p>
<p>He couched, he lay down as a lion; and as a great lion.&nbsp; Who
dare rouse him up?</p>
<p>These were the words of the Eastern sage, as he looked down from
the mountain height upon the camp of Israel, abiding among the groves
of the lowland, according to their tribes, in order, discipline, and
unity.&nbsp; Before a people so organized, he saw well, none of the
nations round could stand.&nbsp; Israel would burst through them, with
the strength of the wild bull crashing through the forest.&nbsp; He
would couch as a lion, and as a great lion.&nbsp; Who dare rouse him
up?</p>
<p>But such a people, the wise Balaam saw, would not be mere conquerors,
like those savage hordes, or plundering armies, which have so often
swept over the earth before and since, leaving no trace behind save
blood and ashes.&nbsp; Israel would be not only a conqueror, but a colonist
and a civilizer.&nbsp; And as the sage looked down on that well-ordered
camp, he seems to have forgotten for a moment that every man therein
was a stern and practised warrior.&nbsp; &lsquo;How goodly,&rsquo; he
cries, &lsquo;are thy tents, oh Jacob, and thy camp, oh Israel.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He likens them, not to the locust swarm, the sea flood, nor the forest
fire, but to the most peaceful, and most fruitful sights in nature or
in art.&nbsp; They are spread forth like the water-courses, which carry
verdure and fertility as they flow.&nbsp; They are planted like the
hanging gardens beside his own river Euphrates, with their aromatic
shrubs and wide-spreading cedars.&nbsp; Their God-given mission may
be stern, but it will be beneficent.&nbsp; They will be terrible in
war; but they will be wealthy, prosperous, civilized and civilizing,
in peace.</p>
<p>Many of you must have seen - all may see - that noble picture of
Israel in Egypt which now hangs in the Royal Academy; in which the Hebrews,
harnessed like beasts of burden, writhing under the whips of their taskmasters,
are dragging to its place some huge Egyptian statue.</p>
<p>Compare the degradation portrayed in that picture with this prophecy
of Balaam&rsquo;s, and then consider - What, in less than two generations,
had so transformed those wretched slaves?</p>
<p>Compare, too, with Balaam&rsquo;s prophecy the hints of their moral
degradation which Scripture gives; - the helplessness, the hopelessness,
the cowardice, the sensuality, which cried, &lsquo;Let us alone, that
we may serve the Egyptians.&nbsp; Because there were no graves in Egypt,
hast thou brought us forth to die in the wilderness?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Whose
highest wish on earth was to sit by the fleshpots of Egypt, where they
did eat bread to the full.&rsquo;&nbsp; What had transformed that race
into a lion, whom none dare rouse up?</p>
<p>Plainly, those forty years of freedom.&nbsp; But of freedom under
a stern military education: of freedom chastened by discipline, and
organized by law.</p>
<p>I say, of freedom.&nbsp; No nation of those days, we have reason
to believe, enjoyed a freedom comparable to that of the old Jews.&nbsp;
They were, to use our modern phrase, the only constitutional people
of the East.&nbsp; The burdensomeness of Moses&rsquo; law, ere it was
overlaid, in later days, by Rabbinical scrupulosity, has been much exaggerated.&nbsp;
In its simpler form, in those early times, it left every man free to
do, as we are expressly told, that which was right in his own eyes,
in many most important matters.&nbsp; Little seems to have been demanded
of the Jews, save those simple ten commandments, which we still hold
to be necessary for all civilized society.</p>
<p>And their obedience was, after all, a moral obedience; the obedience
of free hearts and wills.&nbsp; The law could threaten to slay them
for wronging each other; but they themselves had to enforce the law
against themselves.&nbsp; They were always physically strong enough
to defy it, if they chose.&nbsp; They did not defy it, because they
believed in it, and felt that in obedience and loyalty lay the salvation
of themselves and of their race.</p>
<p>It was not, understand me, the mere physical training of these forty
years which had thus made them men indeed.&nbsp; Whatever they may have
gained by that - the younger generation at least - of hardihood, endurance,
and self-help, was a small matter compared with the moral training which
they had gained - a small matter, compared with the habits of obedience,
self-restraint, self-sacrifice, mutual trust, and mutual help; the inspiration
of a common patriotism, of a common national destiny.&nbsp; Without
that moral discipline, they would have failed each other in need; have
broken up, scattered, or perished, or at least remained as settlers
or as slaves among the Arab tribes.&nbsp; With that moral discipline,
they held together, and continued one people till the last, till they
couched, they lay down as a lion, and as a great lion, and none dare
rouse them up.</p>
<p>You who are here to-day - I speak to those in uniform - are the representatives
of more than one great body of your countrymen, who have determined
to teach themselves something of that lesson which Israel learnt in
the wilderness; not indeed by actual danger and actual need, but by
preparation for dangers and for needs, which are only too possible as
long as there is sin upon this earth.</p>
<p>I believe - I have already seen enough to be sure - that your labour
and that of your comrades will not be in vain; that you will be, as
you surely may be, the better men for that discipline to which you have
subjected yourselves.</p>
<p>You must never forget that there are two sides, a softer and a sterner
side, to the character of the good man; that he, the perfect Christ,
who is the Lion of Judah, taking vengeance, in every age, on all who
wrong their fellow men, is also the Lamb of God, who shed his own blood
for those who rebelled against him.&nbsp; You must recollect that there
are virtues - graces we call them rather - which you may learn elsewhere
better than in the camp or on the drilling ground; graces of character
more devout, more pure, more tender, more humane, yet necessary for
the perfect man, which you will learn rather in your own homes, from
the innocence of your own children, from the counsels and examples of
your mothers and your wives.</p>
<p>But there are virtues - graces we must call them too - just as necessary
for the perfect man, which your present training ought to foster as
(for most of you) no other training can; virtues which the old monk
tried to teach by the stern education of the cloister; which are still
taught, thank God, by the stern education of our public schools; which
you and your comrades may learn by the best of all methods, by teaching
them to yourselves.</p>
<p>For here, and wherever military training goes on, must be kept in
check those sins of self-will, conceit, self-indulgence, which beset
all free and prosperous men.&nbsp; Here must be practised virtues which
(if not the very highest) are yet virtues still, and will be such to
all eternity.</p>
<p>For the moral discipline which goes to make a good soldier or a successful
competitor on this ground, - the self-restraint, the obedience, the
diligence, the punctuality, the patience, the courtesy, the forbearance,
the justice, the temperance, - these virtues, needful for those who
compete in a struggle in which the idler and the debauchee can take
no share, all these go equally toward the making of a good man.</p>
<p>The germs of these virtues you must bring hither with you.&nbsp;
And none can give them to you save the Spirit of God, the giver of all
good.&nbsp; But here you may have them, I trust, quickened into more
active life, strengthened into more settled habits, to stand you in
good stead in all places, all circumstances, all callings; whether you
shall go to serve your country and your family, in trade or agriculture,
at home; or whether you shall go forth, as many of you will, as soldiers,
colonists, or merchants, to carry English speech and English civilization
to the ends of all the earth.</p>
<p>For then, if you learn to endure hardness - in plain English, to
exercise obedience and self-restraint - will you be (whether regulars
or civilians) alike the soldiers of Christ, able and willing to fight
in that war of which He is the Supreme Commander, and which will endure
as long as there is darkness and misery upon the earth; even the battle
of the living God against the baser instincts of our nature, against
ignorance and folly, against lawlessness and tyranny, against brutality
and sloth.&nbsp; Those, the deadly enemies of the human race, you are
all bound to attack, if you be good men and true, wheresoever you shall
meet them invading the kingdom of your Saviour and your God.&nbsp; But
you can only conquer them in others in proportion as you have conquered
them in yourselves.</p>
<p>May God give you grace to conquer them in yourselves more and more;
to profit by the discipline which you may gain by this movement; and
bequeath it, as a precious heirloom, to your children hereafter!</p>
<p>For so, whether at home or abroad, will you help to give your nation
that moral strength, without which physical strength is mere violent
weakness; and by the example and influence of your own discipline, obedience,
and self-restraint, help to fulfil of your own nation the prophecy of
the Seer -</p>
<p>&lsquo;He couched, he lay down as a lion; and as a great lion.&nbsp;
Who dare rouse him up?&rsquo;</p>

<h2>SERMON II. - THE TEMPLE OF WISDOM</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(<i>Preached at Wellington College, All Saints&rsquo; Day</i>, 1866.)</p>
<p>PROVERBS ix. 1-5.</p>
<p>Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:
she hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also
furnished her table.&nbsp; She hath sent forth her maidens; she crieth
upon the highest places of the city, Whoso is simple, let him turn in
hither: and to him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, Come,
eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.</p>
<p>This allegory has been a favourite one with many deep and lofty thinkers.&nbsp;
They mixed it, now and then, with Greek fancies; and brought Ph&oelig;bus,
Apollo, and the Muses into the Temple of Wisdom.&nbsp; But whatever
they added to the allegory, they always preserved the allegory itself.&nbsp;
No words, they felt, could so well express what Wisdom was, and how
it was to be obtained by man.</p>
<p>The stately Temple, built by mystic rules of art; the glorious Lady,
at once its Architect, its Priestess, and its Queen; the feast spread
within for all who felt in themselves divine aspirations after what
is beautiful, and good, and true; the maidens fair and pure, sent forth
throughout the city, among the millions intent only on selfish gain
or selfish pleasure, to call in all who were not content to be only
a more crafty kind of animal, that they might sit down at the feast
among the noble company of guests, - those who have inclined their heart
to wisdom, and sought for understanding as for hid treasures:- this
is a picture which sages and poets felt was true; true for all men,
and for all lands.&nbsp; And it will be, perhaps, looked on as true
once more, as natural, all but literally exact, when we who are now
men are in our graves, and you who are now boys will be grown men; in
the days when the present soulless mechanical notion of the world and
of men shall have died out, and philosophers shall see once more that
Wisdom is no discovery of their own, but the inspiration of the Almighty;
and that this world is no dead and dark machine, but alight with the
Glory, and alive with the Spirit, of God.</p>
<p>But what has this allegory, however true, to do with All Saints&rsquo;
Day?</p>
<p>My dear boys, on all days Wisdom calls you to her feast, by many
weighty arguments, by many loving allurements, by many awful threats.&nbsp;
But on this day, of all the year, she calls you by the memory of the
example of those who sit already and for ever at her feast.&nbsp; By
the memory and example of the wise of every age and every land, she
bids you enter in and feast with them, on the wealth which she, and
they, her faithful servants, have prepared for you.&nbsp; They have
laboured; and they call you, in their mistress&rsquo;s name, to enter
into their labours.&nbsp; She taught them wisdom, and she calls on you
to learn wisdom of them in turn.</p>
<p>Remember, I say, this day, with humility and thankfulness of heart,
the wise who are gone home to their rest.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of noble personages amid the blessed company
of All Saints, whom I might bid you to remember this day.&nbsp; Some
of you are the sons of statesmen or lawyers.&nbsp; I might call on you
to thank God for your fathers, and for every man who has helped to make
or execute wise laws.&nbsp; Some of you are the sons of soldiers.&nbsp;
I might call on you to thank God for your fathers, and for all who have
fought for duty and for their country&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; Some of you
are the sons of clergymen.&nbsp; I might call on you to thank God for
your fathers, and for all who have preached the true God and Jesus Christ
His only-begotten Son, whether at home or abroad.&nbsp; All of you have
mothers, whether on earth or in heaven; I might call on you to thank
God for them, and for every good and true woman who, since the making
of the world, has raised the coarseness and tamed the fierceness of
men into gentleness and reverence, purity, and chivalry.&nbsp; I might
do this: but to-day I will ask you to remember specially - The Wise.</p>
<p>For you are here as scholars; you are here to learn wisdom; you are
here in what should be, and I believe surely is, one of the fore-courts
of that mystic Temple into which Wisdom calls us all.&nbsp; And therefore
it is fit that you should this day remember the wise; for they have
laboured, and you are entering into their labours.&nbsp; Every lesson
which you learn in school, all knowledge which raises you above the
savage or the profligate (who is but a savage dressed in civilized garments),
has been made possible to you by the wise.&nbsp; Every doctrine of theology,
every maxim of morals, every rule of grammar, every process of mathematics,
every law of physical science, every fact of history or of geography,
which you are taught here, is a voice from beyond the tomb.&nbsp; Either
the knowledge itself, or other knowledge which led to it, is an heirloom
to you from men whose bodies are now mouldering in the dust, but whose
spirits live for ever before God, and whose works follow them, going
on, generation after generation, upon the path which they trod while
they were upon earth, the path of usefulness, as lights to the steps
of youth and ignorance.&nbsp; They are the salt of the earth, which
keeps the world of man from decaying back into barbarism.&nbsp; They
are the children of light whom God has set for lights that cannot be
hid.&nbsp; They are the aristocracy of God, into which not many noble,
not many rich, not many mighty are called.&nbsp; Most of them were poor;
many all but unknown in their own time; many died, and saw no fruit
of their labours; some were persecuted, some were slain, even as Christ
the Lord was slain, as heretics, innovators, and corruptors of youth.&nbsp;
Of some, the very names are forgotten.&nbsp; But though their names
be dead, their works live, and grow, and spread, over ever fresh generations
of youth, showing them fresh steps toward that Temple of Wisdom, which
is the knowledge of things as they are; the knowledge of those eternal
laws by which God governs the heavens and the earth, things temporal
and eternal, physical and spiritual, seen and unseen, from the rise
and fall of mighty nations, to the growth and death of the moss on yonder
moors.</p>
<p>They made their mistakes; they had their sins; for they were men
of like passions with ourselves.&nbsp; But this they did - They cried
after Wisdom, and lifted up their voice for understanding; they sought
for her as silver, and searched for her as hid treasure: and not in
vain.</p>
<p>For them, as to every earnest seeker after wisdom, that Heavenly
Lady showed herself and her exceeding beauty; and gave gifts to each
according to his earnestness, his purity and his power of sight.</p>
<p>To some she taught moral wisdom - righteousness, and justice, and
equity, yea, every good path.</p>
<p>To others she showed that political science, which - as Solomon tells
you - is but another side of her beauty, and cannot be parted, however
men may try, from moral wisdom - that Wisdom in whose right hand is
length of days, and in her left hand riches and honour; whose ways are
ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</p>
<p>To others again she showed that physical science which - so Solomon
tells us again - cannot be parted safely from the two others.&nbsp;
For by the same wisdom, he says, which gives alike righteousness and
equity, riches and long life - by that same wisdom, and no other, did
the Lord found the heavens and establish the earth; by that same knowledge
of his are the depths broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</p>
<p>And to some she showed herself, as she did to good Boethius in his
dungeon, in the deepest vale of misery, and the hour of death; when
all seemed to have deserted them, save Wisdom, and the God from whom
she comes; and bade them be of good cheer still, and keep innocency,
and take heed to the thing that is right, for that shall bring a man
peace at the last.</p>
<p>And they beheld her, and loved her, and obeyed her, each according
to his powers: and now they have their reward.</p>
<p>And what is their reward?</p>
<p>How can I tell, dear boys?&nbsp; This, at least can I say, for Scripture
has said it already.&nbsp; That God is merciful in this; that he rewardeth
every man according to his work.&nbsp; This, at least, I can say, for
God incarnate himself has said it already - that to the good and faithful
servant he will say, - &lsquo;Well done.&nbsp; Thou hast been faithful
over a few things: I will make thee ruler over many things.&nbsp; Enter
thou into the joy of thy Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The joy of thy Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; Think of these words a while.&nbsp;
Perhaps they may teach us something of the meaning of All Saints&rsquo;
Day.</p>
<p>For, if Jesus Christ be - as he is - the same yesterday, to-day,
and for ever, then his joy now must be the same as his joy was when
he was here on earth, - to do good, and to behold the fruit of his own
goodness; to see - as Isaiah prophesied of him - to see of the travail
of his soul, and be satisfied.</p>
<p>And so it may be; so it surely is - with them; if blessed spirits
(as I believe) have knowledge of what goes on on earth.&nbsp; They enter
into the joy of their Lord.&nbsp; Therefore they enter into the joy
of doing good.&nbsp; They see of the travail of their soul, and are
satisfied that they have not lived in vain.&nbsp; They see that their
work is going on still on earth; that they, being dead, yet speak, and
call ever fresh generations into the Temple of Wisdom.</p>
<p>My dear boys, take this one thought away with you from this chapel
to-day.&nbsp; Believe that the wise and good of every age and clime
are looking down on you, to see what use you will make of the knowledge
which they have won for you.&nbsp; Whether they laboured, like Kepler
in his garret, or like Galileo in his dungeon, hid in God&rsquo;s tabernacle
from the strife of tongues; or, like Socrates and Plato, in the whirl
and noise - far more wearying and saddening than any loneliness - of
the foolish crowd, they all have laboured for you.&nbsp; Let them rejoice,
when they see you enter into their labours with heart and soul.&nbsp;
Let them rejoice, when they see in each one of you one of the fairest
sights on earth, before men and before God; a docile and innocent boy
striving to become a wise and virtuous man.</p>
<p>And whenever you are tempted to idleness and frivolity; whenever
you are tempted to profligacy and low-mindedness; whenever you are tempted
- as you will be too often in these mean days - to join the scorners
and the fools whom Solomon denounced; tempted to sneering unbelief in
what is great and good, what is laborious and self-sacrificing, and
to the fancy that you were sent into this world merely to get through
it agreeably; - then fortify and ennoble your hearts by Solomon&rsquo;s
vision.&nbsp; Remember who you are, and where you are - that you stand
before the Temple of Wisdom, of the science of things as God has made
them; wherein alone is health and wealth for body and for soul; that
from within the Heavenly Lady calls to you, sending forth her handmaidens
in every art and science which has ever ministered to the good of man;
and that within there await you all the wise and good who have ever
taught on earth, that you may enter in and partake of the feast which
their mistress taught them to prepare.&nbsp; Remember, I say, who you
are - even the sons of God; and remember where you are - for ever upon
sacred ground; and listen with joy and hope to the voice of the Heavenly
Wisdom, as she calls - &lsquo;Whoso is simple, let him come in hither;
and him that wanteth understanding, let him come and eat of my bread,
and drink of the wine that I have mingled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Listen with joy and hope: and yet with fear and trembling, as of
Moses when he hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.&nbsp;
For the voice of Wisdom is none other than the voice of The Spirit of
God, in whom you live, and move, and have your being.</p>

<h2>SERMON III. - PRAYER AND SCIENCE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(<i>Preached at St. Olave&rsquo;s Church, Hart Street, before the
Honourable Corporation of the Trinity House</i>, 1866.)</p>
<p>PSALM cvii. 23, 24, 28.</p>
<p>They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great
waters; these see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.&nbsp;
Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out
of their distresses.</p>
<p>These are days in which there is much dispute about religion and
science - how far they agree with each other; whether they contradict
or interfere with each other.&nbsp; Especially there is dispute about
Providence.&nbsp; Men say, and truly, that the more we look into the
world, the more we find everything governed by fixed and regular laws;
that man is bound to find out those laws, and save himself from danger
by science and experience.&nbsp; But they go on to say, - &lsquo;And
therefore there is no use in prayer.&nbsp; You cannot expect God to
alter the laws of His universe because you ask Him: the world will go
on, and ought to go on, its own way; and the man who prays against danger,
by sea or land, is asking vainly for that which will not be granted
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now I cannot see why we should not allow, - what is certainly true,
- that the world moves by fixed and regular laws: and yet allow at the
same time, - what I believe is just as true, - that God&rsquo;s special
providence watches over all our actions, and that, to use our Lord&rsquo;s
example, not a sparrow falls to the ground without some special reason
why that particular sparrow should fall at that particular moment and
in that particular place.&nbsp; I cannot see why all things should not
move in a divine and wonderful order, and yet why they should not all
work together for good to those who love God.&nbsp; The Psalmist of
old finds no contradiction between the two thoughts.&nbsp; Rather does
the one of them seem to him to explain the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;All things,&rsquo;
says he, &lsquo;continue this day as at the beginning.&nbsp; For all
things serve Thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still it is not to be denied, that this question has been a difficult
one to men in all ages, and that it is so to many now.</p>
<p>But be that as it may, this I say, that, of all men, seafaring men
are the most likely to solve this great puzzle about the limits of science
and of religion, of law and of providence; for, of all callings, theirs
needs at once most science and most religion; theirs is most subject
to laws, and yet most at the mercy of Providence.&nbsp; And I say that
many seafaring men have solved the puzzle for themselves in a very rational
and sound way, though they may not be able to put thoughts into words;
and that they do show, by their daily conduct, that a man may be at
once thoroughly scientific and thoroughly religious.&nbsp; And I say
that this Ancient and Honourable Corporation of the Trinity House is
a proof thereof unto this day; a proof that sound science need not make
us neglect sound religion, nor sound religion make us neglect sound
science.</p>
<p>No man ought to say that seamen have neglected science.&nbsp; It
is the fashion among some to talk of sailors as superstitious.&nbsp;
They must know very little about sailors, and must be very blind to
broad facts, who speak thus of them as a class.&nbsp; Many sailors,
doubtless, are superstitious.&nbsp; But I appeal to every master mariner
here, whether the superstitious men are generally the religious and
godly men; whether it is not generally the most reckless and profligate
men of the crew who are most afraid of sailing on a Friday, and who
give way to other silly fancies which I shall not mention in this sacred
place.&nbsp; And I appeal, too, to public experience, whether many,
I may say most, of those to whom seamanship and sea-science owes most,
have not been God-fearing Christian men?</p>
<p>Be sure of this, that if seamen, as a class, had been superstitious,
they would never have done for science what they have done.&nbsp; And
what they have done, all the world knows.&nbsp; To seamen, and to men
connected with the sea, what do we not owe, in geography, hydrography,
meteorology, astronomy, natural history?&nbsp; At the present moment,
the world owes them large improvements in dynamics, and in the new uses
of steam and iron.&nbsp; It may be fairly said that the mariner has
done more toward the knowledge of Nature than any other personage in
the world, save the physician.</p>
<p>For seamen have been forced, by the nature of their calling, to be
scientific men.&nbsp; From the very earliest ages in which the first
canoe put out to sea, the mariner has been educated by the most practical
of all schoolmasters, namely, danger.&nbsp; He has carried his life
in his hand day and night; he has had to battle with the most formidable
and the most seemingly capricious of the brute powers of nature; with
storms, with ice, with currents, with unknown rocks and shoals, with
the vicissitudes of climate, and the terrible and seemingly miraculous
diseases which change of climate engenders.&nbsp; He has had to fight
Nature; and to conquer her, if he could, by understanding her; by observing
facts, and by facing facts.&nbsp; He dared not, like a scholar in his
study, indulge in theories and fancies about how things ought to be.&nbsp;
He had to find out how they really were.&nbsp; He dared not say, According
to my theory of the universe this current ought to run in such a direction;
he had to find out which way it did actually run, according to God&rsquo;s
method of the universe, lest it should run him ashore.&nbsp; Everywhere,
I say, and all day long, the seaman has to observe facts and to use
facts, unless he intends to be drowned; and therefore, so far from being
a superstitious man, who refuses to inquire into facts, but puts vain
dreams in their stead, the sailor is for the most part a very scientific-minded
man: observant, patient, accurate, truthful; conquering Nature, as the
great saying is, because he obeys her.</p>
<p>But if seamen have been forced to be scientific, they have been equally
forced to be religious.&nbsp; They that go down to the sea in ships
see both the works of the Lord, and also His wonders in the deep.&nbsp;
They see God&rsquo;s works, regular, orderly, the same year by year,
voyage by voyage, and tide by tide; and they learn the laws of them,
and are so far safe.&nbsp; But they also see God&rsquo;s wonders - strange,
sudden, astonishing dangers, which have, no doubt, their laws, but none
which man has found out as yet.&nbsp; Over them they cannot reason and
foretell; they can only pray and trust.&nbsp; With all their knowledge,
they have still plenty of ignorance; and therefore, with all their science,
they have still room for religion.&nbsp; Is there an old man in this
church who has sailed the seas for many a year, who does not know that
I speak truth?&nbsp; Are there not men here who have had things happen
to them, for good and for evil, beyond all calculation? who have had
good fortune of which they could only say, The glory be to God, for
I had no share therein? or who have been saved, as by miracle, from
dangers of which they could only say, It was of the Lord&rsquo;s mercies
that we were not swallowed up? who must, if they be honest men, as they
are, say with the Psalmist, We cried unto the Lord in our trouble, and
he delivered us out of our distress?</p>
<p>And this it is that I said at first, that no men were so fit as seamen
to solve the question, where science ends and where religion begins;
because no men&rsquo;s calling depends so much on science and reason,
and so much, at the same time, on Providence and God&rsquo;s merciful
will.</p>
<p>Therefore, when men say, as they will, - If this world is governed
by fixed laws, and if we have no right to ask God to alter his laws
for our sakes, then what use in prayer?&nbsp; I will answer, - Go to
the seaman, and ask him what he thinks.&nbsp; The puzzle may seem very
great to a comfortable landsman, sitting safe in his study at home;
but it ought to be no puzzle at all to the master mariner in his cabin,
with his chart and his Bible open before him, side by side.&nbsp; He
ought to know well enough where reason stops and religion begins.&nbsp;
He ought to know when to work, and when to pray.&nbsp; He ought to know
the laws of the sea and of the sky.&nbsp; But he ought to know too how
to pray, without asking God to alter those laws, as presumptuous and
superstitious men are wont to do.</p>
<p>Take as an instance the commonest of all - a storm.&nbsp; We know
that storms are not caused (as folk believed in old time) by evil spirits;
that they are natural phenomena, obeying certain fixed laws; that they
are necessary from time to time; that they are probably, on the whole,
useful.</p>
<p>And we know two ways of facing a storm, one of which you may see
too often among the boatmen of the Mediterranean - How a man shall say,
I know nothing as to how, or why, or when, a storm should come; and
I care not to know.&nbsp; If one falls on me, I will cry for help to
the Panagia, or St. Nicholas, or some other saint, and perhaps they
will still the storm by miracle.&nbsp; That is superstition, the child
of ignorance and fear.</p>
<p>And you may have seen what comes of that temper of mind.&nbsp; How,
when the storm comes, instead of order, you have confusion; instead
of courage, cowardice; instead of a calm and manly faith, a miserable
crying of every man to his own saint, while the vessel is left to herself
to sink or swim.</p>
<p>But what is the temper of true religion, and of true science likewise?&nbsp;
The seaman will say, I dare not pray that there may be no storm.&nbsp;
I cannot presume to interfere with God&rsquo;s government.&nbsp; If
there ought to be a storm, there will be one: if not, there will be
none.&nbsp; But I can forecast the signs of the weather; I can consult
my barometer; I can judge, by the new lights of science, what course
the storm will probably take; and I can do my best to avoid it.</p>
<p>But does that make religion needless?&nbsp; Does that make prayer
useless?&nbsp; How so?&nbsp; The seaman may say, I dare not pray that
the storm may not come.&nbsp; But there is no necessity that I should
be found in its path.&nbsp; And I may pray, and I will pray, that God
may so guide and govern my voyage, and all its little accidents, that
I may pass it by.&nbsp; I know that I can forecast the storm somewhat;
and if I do not try to do that, I am tempting God: but I may pray, I
will pray, that my forecast may be correct.&nbsp; I will pray the Spirit
of God, who gives man understanding, to give me a right judgment, a
sound mind, and a calm heart, that I may make no mistake and neglect
no precaution; and if I fail, and sink - God&rsquo;s will be done.&nbsp;
It is a good will to me and all my crew; and into the hands of the good
God who has redeemed me, I commend my spirit, and their spirits likewise.</p>
<p>This much, therefore, we may say of prayer.&nbsp; We may always pray
to be made better men.&nbsp; We may always pray to be made wiser men.&nbsp;
These prayers will always be answered; for they are prayers for the
very Spirit of God himself, from whom comes all goodness and all wisdom,
and it can never be wrong to ask to be made right.</p>
<p>There are surely, too, evils so terrible, that when they threaten
us - if God being our Father means anything, - if Christ being our example
means anything - then we have a right to cry, like our Lord himself,
&lsquo;Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:&rsquo;
if we only add, like our Lord, &lsquo;Nevertheless, not as I will, but
as Thou wilt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And of dangers in general this we may say - that if we pray against
known dangers which we can avoid, we do nothing but tempt God: but that
against unknown and unseen dangers we may always pray.&nbsp; For instance,
if a sailor needlessly lodges over a foul, tideless harbour, or sleeps
in a tropical mangrove swamp, he has no right to pray against cholera
and fever; for he has done his best to give himself cholera and fever,
and has thereby tempted God.&nbsp; But if he goes into a new land, of
whose climate, diseases, dangers, he is utterly ignorant, then he has
surely a right to pray God to deliver him from those dangers; and if
not, - if he is doomed to suffer from them, - to pray God that he may
discover and understand the new dangers of that new land, in order to
warn future travellers against them, and so make his private suffering
a benefit to mankind.</p>
<p>This, then, is our duty as to known dangers, - to guard ourselves
against them by science, and the reason which God has given us; and
as to unknown dangers, to pray to God to deliver us from them, if it
seem good to him: but above all, to pray to him to deliver us from them
in the best way, the surest way, the most lasting way, the way in which
we may not only preserve ourselves, but our fellow-men and generations
yet unborn; namely, by giving us wisdom and understanding to discover
the dangers, to comprehend them, and to conquer them, by reason and
by science.</p>
<p>This is the spirit of sound science and of sound religion.&nbsp;
And it was in this spirit, and for this very end, that this Ancient
and Honourable Corporation of the Trinity House was founded more than
three hundred years ago.&nbsp; Not merely to pray to God and to the
saints, after the ancient fashion, to deliver all poor mariners from
dangers of the seas.&nbsp; That was a natural prayer, and a pious one,
as far as it went: but it did not go far enough.&nbsp; For, as a fact,
God did not always answer it: he did not always see fit to deliver those
who called upon him.&nbsp; Gallant ships went down with all their crews.&nbsp;
It was plain that God would not always deliver poor mariners, even though
they cried to him in their distress.</p>
<p>Then, in the sixteenth century, when men&rsquo;s minds were freed
from many old superstitions, by a better understanding both of Holy
Scripture and of the laws of nature, the master mariners of England
took a wiser course.</p>
<p>They said, God will not always help poor mariners: but he will always
teach them to deliver themselves.&nbsp; And so they built this House,
not in the name of the Virgin Mary or any saints in heaven, but, with
a deep understanding of what was needed, in the most awful name of God
himself.&nbsp; Thereby they went to the root and ground of this matter,
and of all matters.&nbsp; They went to the source of all law and order;
to the source of all force and life; and to the source, likewise, of
all love and mercy; when they founded their House in the name of the
Father of Lights, in whom men live and move and have their being; from
whom comes every good and perfect gift, and without whom not a sparrow
falls to the ground; in the name of the Son, who was born on earth a
man, and tasted sorrow, and trial, and death for every man; in the name
of the Holy Ghost, who inspires man with the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
and gives him a right judgment in all things, putting into his heart
good desires, and enabling him to bring them to good effect.&nbsp; And
so, believing that the ever-blessed Trinity would teach them to help
themselves and their fellow-mariners, they set to work, like truly God-fearing
men, not to hire monks to sing and say masses for them, but to set up
for themselves lights and sea-marks, and to take order for the safe
navigation of these seas, like men who believed indeed that they were
the children of God, and that God would prosper his children in as far
as they used that reason which he himself had bestowed upon them.</p>
<p>It is for these men&rsquo;s sakes, as well as for our own, that we
are met together here this day.&nbsp; We are met to commemorate the
noble dead; not in any Popish or superstitious fashion, as if they needed
our prayers, or we needed their miraculous assistance: but in the good
old Protestant scriptural sense - to thank God for all his servants
departed this life in his faith and fear, and to pray that God may give
us grace to follow their good examples; and especially to thank him
for the founders of this ancient Trinity House, which stands here as
a token to all generations of Britons, that science and religion are
not contrary to each other, but twin sisters, meant to aid each other
and mankind in the battle with the brute forces of this universe.</p>
<p>We are met together here to thank God for all gallant mariners, and
for all who have helped mariners toward safety and success; for all
who have made discoveries in hydrography or meteorology, in navigation,
or in commerce, adding to the safety of seamen, and to the health and
wealth of the human race; for all who have set noble examples to their
crews, facing danger manfully and dying at their posts, as many a man
has died, a martyr to his duty; for all who, living active, and useful,
and virtuous lives in their sea calling, have ended as they lived, God-fearing
Christian men.</p>
<p>To thank God for all these we are met together here; and to pray
to God likewise that he would send his Spirit into the hearts of seamen,
and of those who deal with seamen; and specially into the hearts of
the Royal the Master and the Worshipful the Elder Brethren of this Ancient
and Honourable House; that they may be true, and loyal, and obedient
to that divine name in which they are met together here this day - the
name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the ever-blessed Trinity, the giver
of all good gifts, in whom we live, and move, and have our being; always
keeping God&rsquo;s commandments and looking for God&rsquo;s guidance,
and setting to those beneath them an example of sound reason, virtue,
and religion; that so there may never be wanting to this land a race
of seamen who shall trust in God to teach them all they need to know,
and to dispose of their bodies and souls as seemeth best to his most
holy will; who, fearing God, shall fear nought else, but shall defy
the dangers of the seas, and all the brute forces of climates and of
storms; who shall set in foreign lands an example of justice and mercy,
of true civilization and true religion; and so shall still maintain
the marine of Great Britain, as it has been for now three hundred years,
a safeguard and a glory to these islands, and a blessing to the coasts
of all the world.</p>

<h2>SERMON IV. - GOD&rsquo;S TRAINING</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>DEUTERONOMY viii. 2-5.</p>
<p>And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee
these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee,
to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments
or no.&nbsp; And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed
thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know;
that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but
by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man
live.&nbsp; Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot
swell, these forty years.&nbsp; Thou shalt also consider in thine heart,
that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee.</p>
<p>This is the lesson of our lives.&nbsp; This is training, not only
for the old Jews, but for us.&nbsp; What was true of them, is more or
less true of us.&nbsp; And we read these verses to teach us that God&rsquo;s
ways with man do not change; that his fatherly hand is over us, as well
as over the people of Israel; that we are in God&rsquo;s schoolhouse,
as they were; that their blessings are our blessings, their dangers
are our dangers; that, as St. Paul says, all these things are written
for our example.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger.&rsquo;&nbsp;
How true to life that is!&nbsp; How often there comes to a man, at his
setting out in life, a time which humbles him; a time of disappointment,
when he finds that he is not so clever as he thought, as able to help
himself as he thought; when his fine plans fail him; when he does not
know how to settle in life, how to marry, how to provide for a family.&nbsp;
Perhaps the man actually does hunger, and go through a time of want
and struggle.&nbsp; Then, it may be, he cries in his heart - How hard
it is for me!&nbsp; How hard that the golden days of youth should be
all dark and clouded over!&nbsp; How hard to have to suffer anxiety
and weary hard work, just when I am able to enjoy myself most!</p>
<p>It is hard: but worse things than hard things may happen to a man.&nbsp;
Far worse is it to grow up, as some men do, in wealth, and ease, and
luxury, with all the pleasures of this life found ready to their hands.&nbsp;
Some men, says the proverb, are &lsquo;born with a golden spoon in their
mouth.&rsquo;&nbsp; God help them if they are!&nbsp; Idleness, profligacy,
luxury, self-conceit, no care for their duty, no care for God, no feeling
that they are in God&rsquo;s school-house - these are too often the
fruits of that breeding up.&nbsp; How hardly will they learn that man
doth not live by bread alone, or by money alone, or by comfort alone,
but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.&nbsp; Truly,
said our Lord, &lsquo;how hardly shall they that have riches enter into
the kingdom of heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not those who earn riches by manful
and honest labour; not those who come to wealth after long training
to make them fit to use wealth: but those who have wealth; who are born
amid luxury and pomp; who have never known want, and the golden lessons
which want brings. - God help them, for they need his help even more
than the poor young man who is at his wit&rsquo;s end how to live.&nbsp;
For him God is helping.&nbsp; His very want, and struggles, and anxiety
may be God&rsquo;s help to him.&nbsp; They help him to control himself,
and do with a little; they help him to strengthen his character, and
to bring out all the powers of mind that God has given him.&nbsp; God
is humbling him, that he may know that man doth not live by bread alone,
but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.&nbsp; God,
too, if he trusts in God, will feed him with manna - spiritual manna,
not bodily.&nbsp; He fed the Jews in the wilderness with manna, to show
them that his power was indeed almighty - that if he did not see fit
to help his people in one way, he could help them just as easily in
another.&nbsp; And so with every man who trusts in God.&nbsp; In unforeseen
ways, he is helped.&nbsp; In unforeseen ways, he prospers; his life,
as he goes on, becomes very different from what he expected, from what
he would have liked; his fine dreams fade away, as he finds the world
quite another place from what he fancied it: but still he prospers.&nbsp;
If he be earnest and honest, patient and God-fearing, he prospers; God
brings him through.&nbsp; His raiment doth not wax old, neither doth
his foot swell, through all his forty years&rsquo; wandering in the
wilderness.&nbsp; He is not tired out, he does not break down, though
he may have to work long and hard.&nbsp; As his day is, so his strength
shall be.&nbsp; God holds him up, strengthens and refreshes him, and
brings him through years of labour from the thought of which he shrank
when he was young.</p>
<p>And so the man learns that man doth not live by bread alone, but
by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; that not in the
abundance of things which he possesses, not in money; not in pleasure,
not even in comforts, does the life of man consist: but in this - to
learn his duty, and to have strength from God to do it.&nbsp; Truly
said the prophet - &lsquo;It is good for a man to learn to bear the
yoke in his youth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After that sharp training a man will prosper; because he is fit to
prosper.&nbsp; He has learnt the golden lesson.&nbsp; He can be trusted
with comforts, wealth, honour.&nbsp; Let him have them, if God so will,
and use them well.</p>
<p>Only, only, when a time of ease and peace comes to him in his middle
age, let him not forget the warning of the latter part of the chapter.</p>
<p>For there is another danger awaiting him, as it awaited those old
Jews; the danger of prosperity in old age.&nbsp; Ah my friends, that
is a sore temptation - the sorest, perhaps, which can meet a man in
the long struggle of life, the temptation which success brings.&nbsp;
In middle age, when he has learnt his business, and succeeded in it;
when he has fought his battle with the world, and conquered more or
less; when he has made his way up, and seems to himself safe, and comfortable,
and thriving; when he feels that he is a shrewd, thrifty, experienced
man, who knows the world and how to prosper in it - Then how easy it
is for him to say in his heart - as Moses feared that those old Jews
would say - &lsquo;My might and the power of my wit has gotten me this
wealth,&rsquo; and to forget the Lord his God, who guided him and trained
him through all the struggles and storms of early life; and so to become
vainly confident, worldly and hard-hearted: undevout and ungodly, even
though he may keep himself respectable enough, and fall into no open
sin.</p>
<p>Therefore it is, I think, that while we see so many lives which have
been sad lives of poverty, and labour, and struggle, end peacefully
and cheerfully, in a sunshiny old age, like a still bright evening after
a day of storm and rain; so on the other hand we see lives which have
been prosperous and happy ones for many years, end sadly in bereavement,
poverty, or disappointment, as did the life of David, the man after
God&rsquo;s own heart.&nbsp; God guided him through all the dangers
and temptations of youth, and through them all he trusted God.&nbsp;
God brought him safely to success, honour, a royal crown; and he thanked
God, and acknowledged his goodness.&nbsp; And yet after a while his
heart was puffed up, and he forgot God, and all he owed to God, and
became a tyrant, an adulterer, a murderer.&nbsp; He repented of his
sin: but he could not escape the punishment of it.&nbsp; His children
were a curse to him; the sword never departed from his house; and his
last years were sad enough, and too sad.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was God&rsquo;s mercy to him; God&rsquo;s way of remembering
him again, and bringing him back to him.&nbsp; Perhaps too that same
is God&rsquo;s way of bringing back many a man in our own days who has
wandered from him in success and prosperity.</p>
<p>God grant that we may never need that terrible chastisement.&nbsp;
God grant that we, if success and comfort come to us, may never wander
so far from God, but that we may be brought back to him by the mere
humbling of old age itself, without needing affliction over and above.</p>
<p>Yes, by old age alone.&nbsp; Old age, it seems to me, is a most wholesome
and blessed medicine for the soul of man.&nbsp; Good it is to find that
we can work no longer, and rejoice no more in our own strength and cunning.&nbsp;
Good it is to feel our mortal bodies decay, and to learn that we are
but dust, and that when we turn again to our dust, all our thoughts
will perish.&nbsp; Good it is to see the world changing round us, going
ahead of us, leaving us and our opinions behind.&nbsp; Good perhaps
for us - though not for them - to see the young who are growing up around
us looking down on our old-fashioned notions.&nbsp; Good for us: because
anything is good which humbles us, makes us feel our own ignorance,
weakness, nothingness, and cast ourselves utterly on that God in whom
we live, and move, and have our being; and on the mercy of that Saviour
who died for us on the Cross; and on that Spirit of God from whose holy
inspiration alone all good desires and good actions come.</p>
<p>God grant that that may be our end.&nbsp; That old age, when it comes,
may chasten us, humble us, soften us; and that our second childhood
may be a second childhood indeed, purged from the conceit, the scheming,
the fierceness, the covetousness which so easily beset us in our youth
and manhood; and tempered down to gentleness, patience, humility, and
faith.&nbsp; God grant that instead of clinging greedily to life, and
money, and power, and fame, we may cling only to God, and have one only
wish as we draw near our end. - &lsquo;From my youth up hast thou taught
me, Oh God, and hitherto I have declared thy wondrous works.&nbsp; Now
also that I am old and grey-headed, Oh Lord, forsake me not, till I
have showed thy goodness to this generation, and thy power to those
who are yet to come.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SERMON V. - GOOD FRIDAY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>HEBREWS ix. 13, 14.</p>
<p>For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer
sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: How
much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit
offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead
works to serve the living God?</p>
<p>The three collects for Good Friday are very grand and very remarkable.&nbsp;
In the first we pray:-</p>
<p>&lsquo;Almighty God, we beseech thee graciously to behold this thy
family, for which our Lord Jesus Christ was contented to be betrayed,
and given up into the hands of wicked men, and to suffer death upon
the cross, who now liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost
ever one God, world without end.&nbsp; Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the second we pray:-</p>
<p>&lsquo;Almighty and everlasting God, by whose Spirit the whole body
of the Church is governed and sanctified: Receive our supplications
and prayers, which we offer before thee for all estates of men in thy
holy Church, that every member of the same, in his vocation and ministry,
may truly and godly serve thee; through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.&nbsp;
Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the third we pray:-</p>
<p>&lsquo;O merciful God, who hast made all men, and hatest nothing
that thou hast made, nor wouldest the death of a sinner, but rather
that he should be converted and live: Have mercy upon all Jews, Turks,
Infidels, and Hereticks, and take from them all ignorance, hardness
of heart, and contempt of thy Word; and so fetch them home, blessed
Lord, to thy flock, that they may be saved among the remnant of the
true Israelites, and be made one fold under one shepherd, Jesus Christ
our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one
God, world without end.&nbsp; Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now these collects give us the keynote of Good Friday; they tell
us what the Church wishes us to think of on Good Friday.</p>
<p>We are to think of Christ&rsquo;s death and passion.&nbsp; Of that
there is no doubt.</p>
<p>But we need not on Good Friday, or perhaps at any other time, trouble
our minds with the unfathomable questions, How did Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice
take away our sins?&nbsp; How does Christ&rsquo;s blood purge our conscience?</p>
<p>Mere &lsquo;theories of the Atonement,&rsquo; as they are called,
have very little teaching in them, and still less comfort.&nbsp; Wise
and good men have tried their minds upon them in all ages; they have
done their best to explain Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice, and the atonement
which he worked out on the cross on Good Friday: but it does not seem
to me that they have succeeded.&nbsp; I never read yet any explanation
which I could fully understand; which fully satisfied my conscience,
or my reason either; or which seemed to me fully to agree with and explain
all the texts of Scripture bearing on this great subject.</p>
<p>But is it possible to explain the matter?&nbsp; Is it not too deep
for mortal man?&nbsp; Is it not one of the deep things of God, and of
God alone, before which we must worship and believe?&nbsp; As for explaining
or understanding it, must not that be impossible, from its very nature?</p>
<p>For, consider the first root and beginning of the whole question.&nbsp;
Put it in the simplest shape, to which all Christians will agree.&nbsp;
The Father sent the Son to die for the world.&nbsp; Most true: but who
can explain those words?&nbsp; We are stopped at the very first step
by an abyss.&nbsp; Who can tell us what is meant by the Father sending
the Son?&nbsp; What is the relation, the connexion, between the Father
and the Son?&nbsp; If we do not know that, we can know nothing about
the matter, about the very root and ground thereof.&nbsp; And we do
know little or nothing.&nbsp; The Bible only gives us scattered hints
here and there.&nbsp; It is one of the things of which we may say, with
St. Paul, that we know in part, and see through a glass darkly.&nbsp;
How, then, dare we talk as if we knew all, as if we saw clearly?&nbsp;
The atonement is a blessed and awful mystery hidden in God: ordained
by and between God the Father and God the Son.&nbsp; And who can search
out that?&nbsp; Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been
his counsellor?&nbsp; Did we sit by, and were we taken into his counsels,
when he made the world?&nbsp; Not we.&nbsp; Neither were we when he
redeemed the world.&nbsp; He did it.&nbsp; Let that be enough for us.&nbsp;
And he did it in love.&nbsp; Let that be enough for us.</p>
<p>God the Father so loved the world, that he sent his Son into the
world, that the world by him might be saved.&nbsp; God the Son so loved
the world, that he came to do his Father&rsquo;s will, and put away
sin by the sacrifice of himself.&nbsp; That is enough for us.&nbsp;
Let it be enough; and let us take simply, honestly, literally, and humbly,
like little children, everything which the Bible says about it, without
trying or pretending to understand, but only to believe.</p>
<p>We can believe that Christ&rsquo;s blood can purge our conscience,
though we cannot explain in any words of our own how it can do so.&nbsp;
We can believe that God made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin,
though we not only cannot but dare not try to explain so awful a mystery.&nbsp;
We can believe that Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice on the cross was a propitiation
for sin, though neither we, nor (as I hold) any man on earth, can tell
exactly what the words sacrifice and propitiation mean.&nbsp; And so
with all the texts which speak of Christ&rsquo;s death and passion,
and that atonement for sin which he, in his boundless mercy, worked
out this day.&nbsp; Let us not torment our minds with arguments in which
there are a hundred words of man&rsquo;s invention to one word of Holy
Scripture, while the one word of Scripture has more in it than the hundred
words of man can explain.&nbsp; But let us have faith in Christ.&nbsp;
I mean, let us trust him that he has done all that can or need be done;
that whatsoever was needed to reconcile God to man, he has done, for
he is perfect God; that whatever was needed to reconcile man to God,
he has done, for he is perfect man.</p>
<p>Let us, instead of puzzling ourselves as to how the Lamb of God takes
away the sins of the world, believe that he knows, and that he lives,
and cry to him as to the living God, - Lamb of God, who takest away
the sins of the world, have mercy on us, and take our sins away.</p>
<p>And let us beseech God this day, graciously to behold his family,
the nations of Christendom, for which our Lord Jesus Christ was contented
to be betrayed into the hands of wicked men, and suffer death upon the
cross.&nbsp; Let us ask this, even though we do not fully understand
what Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross did for mankind.&nbsp; That was
the humble, childlike, really believing spirit of the early Christians.&nbsp;
God grant us the same spirit; we need it much in these very times.</p>
<p>For if we are of that spirit, my friends, then, instead of tormenting
our minds as to the how and why of Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice on the cross,
we shall turn our hearts, and not merely our minds, to the practical
question - What shall we do?&nbsp; If Christ died for us, what shall
we do?&nbsp; What shall we ask God to help us to do?&nbsp; To that the
second collect gives a clear answer at once - Serve the living God.</p>
<p>And how?&nbsp; By dead works?&nbsp; By mere outward forms and ceremonies,
church-goings, psalm-singings, sermon-hearings?&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp;
These are right and good; but they are dead works, which cannot take
away sin, any more than could the gifts and sacrifices, the meats and
drinks of the old Jewish law.&nbsp; Those, says St. Paul, could not
make him that did the sacrifice perfect as pertaining to the conscience.&nbsp;
They could not give him a clear conscience; they could not make him
sure that God had forgiven him; they could not give him spirit and comfort
to say - Now I can leave the church a forgiven man, a new man, and begin
a fresh life; and go about my daily business in joyfulness and peace
of mind, sure that God will help me, and bless me, and enable me to
serve him in my calling.</p>
<p>No, says St. Paul.&nbsp; More than dead works are wanted to purge
a man&rsquo;s conscience.&nbsp; Nothing will do that but the blood of
Christ.&nbsp; And that will do it.&nbsp; He, the spotless Lamb, has
offered himself to God, as a full and perfect and sufficient sacrifice,
offering, and satisfaction for the sins of the whole world; and therefore
for thy sins, whoever thou art, be thy sins many or few.&nbsp; Believe
that; for thou art a man for whom Christ died.&nbsp; Claim thy share
in Christ&rsquo;s blood.&nbsp; Believe that he has died for thee; that
he has blotted out thy sins in the blood of his cross; that thou needest
not try to blot them out by any dead works, forms, or ceremonies whatsoever;
for Christ has done and suffered already all for thee.&nbsp; Thou art
forgiven.&nbsp; Put away thy sins, for God has put them away; rise,
and be a new man.&nbsp; Thou art one of God&rsquo;s holy Church.&nbsp;
God has justified thee.&nbsp; Let him sanctify thee likewise.&nbsp;
God&rsquo;s spirit is with thee to guide thee, to inspire thee, and
make thee holy.&nbsp; Serve thy Father and thy Master, the Living God,
sure that he is satisfied with thee for Christ&rsquo;s sake; that thou
art in thy right state henceforward; in thy right place in this world;
and that he blesses all thy efforts to live a right life, and to do
thy duty.</p>
<p>But how to serve him, and where?&nbsp; By doing something strange
and fantastic?&nbsp; By giving up thy business, money, time?&nbsp; Going
to the ends of the earth?&nbsp; Making what some will call some great
sacrifice for God?</p>
<p>Not so.&nbsp; All that may be, and generally is, the fruit of mere
self-will and self-conceit.&nbsp; God has made a sacrifice for thee.&nbsp;
Let that be enough.&nbsp; If he wants thee to make a sacrifice to him
in return, he will compel thee to make it, doubt it not.&nbsp; But meanwhile
abide in the calling wherein thou art called.&nbsp; Do the duty which
lies nearest thee.&nbsp; Whether thou art squire or labourer, rich or
poor; whether thy duty is to see after thy children, or to mind thy
shop, do thy duty.&nbsp; For that is thy vocation and calling; that
is the ministry in which thou canst serve God, by serving thy fellow-creatures
for whom Christ died.</p>
<p>This day the grand prayer has gone up throughout Christ&rsquo;s Church
- and thou hast joined in it - for all estates of men in his holy Church;
for all estates, from kings and statesmen governing the nations, down
to labouring men tilling in the field, and poor women washing and dressing
their children at home, that each and all of them may do their work
well, whatever it is, and thereby serve the Living God.&nbsp; For now
their work, however humble, is God&rsquo;s work; Christ has bought it
and redeemed it with his blood.&nbsp; When he redeemed human nature,
he redeemed all that human nature can and ought to do, save sin.&nbsp;
All human duties and occupations are purified by the blood of Christ&rsquo;s
cross; and if we do our duty well, we do it to the Lord, and not to
man; and the Lord blesses us therein, and will help us to fulfil our
work like Christian men, by the help of his Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>And for those who know not Christ?&nbsp; For them, too, we can pray.&nbsp;
For, for them too Christ died.&nbsp; They, too, belong to Christ, for
he has bought them with his most precious blood.&nbsp; What will happen
to them we know not: but this we know, that they are his sheep, lost
sheep though they may be; and that we are bound to pray, that he would
bring them home to his flock.</p>
<p>But how will he bring them back?&nbsp; That, again, we know not.&nbsp;
But why need we know?&nbsp; If Christ knows how to do it, surely we
need not.&nbsp; Let us trust him to do his own work in his own way.</p>
<p>But will he do it?&nbsp; My friends, if we wish for the salvation
of all Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Heretics, do you suppose that we are
more compassionate to them than God who made them?&nbsp; Who is more
likely to pity the heathen?&nbsp; We who send a few missionaries to
teach them: or God who sent his own Son to die for them?</p>
<p>Oh trust God, and trust Christ; for this, as for all other things.&nbsp;
Believe that for the heathen, as for us, he is able to do exceedingly
and abundantly beyond all that we can ask or think; and believe too,
that if we do ask, we do not ask in vain; that this collect which has
gone up every Good Friday for centuries past, from millions of holy
hearts throughout the world, has not gone up unheard; that it will be
answered - we know not how - but answered still; and that to Jew and
Turk, Heathen and Heretic, this day will prove hereafter to have been,
what it is to us, Good Friday.</p>

<h2>SERMON VI. - FALSE CIVILIZATION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>JEREMIAH xxxv. 19.</p>
<p>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son
of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.</p>
<p>Let us think a while this morning what this text has to do with us;
and why this strange story of the Rechabites is written for our instruction,
in the pages of Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>Let us take the story as it stands, and search the Scriptures simply
for it.&nbsp; For the Bible will surely tell its own story best, and
teach its own lesson best.</p>
<p>These Rechabites, who were they?&nbsp; Or, indeed we may ask - Who
are they?&nbsp; For they are said to exist still.</p>
<p>They were not Israelites, but wild Arabs, a branch of the Kenite
tribe, which claimed - at least its chiefs - to be descended from Abraham,
by his wife Keturah.&nbsp; They joined the Israelites, and wandered
with them into the land of Canaan.</p>
<p>But they never settled down, as the Israelites did, into farmers
and townsfolk.&nbsp; They never became what we call civilized: though
they had a civilization of their own, which stood them in good stead,
and kept them - and keeps them, it would seem, to this day, - strong
and prosperous, while great cities and mighty nations have been destroyed
round about them.&nbsp; They kept their old simple Arab customs, living
in their great black camels&rsquo; hair tents, feeding their flocks
and herds, as they wandered from forest to forest and lawn to lawn,
living on the milk of the flock, and it would seem, on locusts and wild
honey, as did John the Baptist after them.&nbsp; They had (as many Arab
tribes have still) neither corn, seed-field, nor vineyard.&nbsp; Wild
men they were in their ways, yet living a simple wholesome life; till
in the days of Ahab and Jehu there arose among them a chief called Jonadab
the son of Rechab, of the house of Hammath.&nbsp; Why he was called
the son of Rechab is not clearly known.&nbsp; &lsquo;The son of the
rider,&rsquo; or &lsquo;the son of the chariot,&rsquo; seems to be the
most probable meaning of the name.&nbsp; So that these Rechabites, at
least, had horses - as many Arab tribes have now - and whether they
rode them, or used them to draw their goods about in carts, like many
other wild tribes, they seem to have gained from Jonadab the name of
Rechabim, the sons of Rechab, the sons of the rider, or the sons of
the chariot.</p>
<p>Of Jonadab the son of Rechab, you heard three Sundays since, in that
noble passage of 2 Kings x. where Jehu, returning from the slaughter
of the idolatrous kings, and going to slay the priests of Baal, meets
Jonadab and asks him, Is thy heart right - that is, sound in the worship
of God, and determined to put down idolatry - as my heart is with thy
heart?&nbsp; We hear of him and his tribe no more till the days of Jeremiah,
250 years after, in the story from which my text is taken.&nbsp; What
Jonadab&rsquo;s reasons may have been for commanding his tribe neither
to settle in towns, nor till the ground, it is not difficult to guess.&nbsp;
He may have dreaded lest his people, by settling in the towns, should
learn the idolatry of the Israelites.&nbsp; He may have dreaded, likewise,
lest they should give way to that same luxury and profligacy in which
the Israelites indulged - and especially lest they should be demoralized
by that drunkenness of which the prophets speak, as one of the crying
sins of that age.&nbsp; He may have feared, too, lest their settling
down as landholders or townsmen would cause them to be absorbed and
lost among the nation of the Israelites, and probably involved in their
ruin.&nbsp; Be that as it may, he laid his command upon his tribe, and
his command was obeyed.</p>
<p>Of the after-history of these simple God-fearing folk we know very
little.&nbsp; But what we do know is well worth remembering.&nbsp; They
were, it seems, carried away captive to Babylon with the rest of the
Jews; and with them they came back to Jerusalem.&nbsp; Meanwhile, they
had intermarried with the priests of the tribe of Levi; and they assisted
at the worship and sacrifices, - &lsquo;standing before the Lord&rsquo;
(as Jeremiah had foretold) &lsquo;in the temple,&rsquo; but living (as
some say) outside the walls in their tents.&nbsp; And it is worth remembering,
that we have one psalm in the Bible, which was probably written either
by one of these Rechabites, or by Jeremiah for them to sing, and that
a psalm which you all know well, the old man&rsquo;s psalm, as it has
well been called - the 71st Psalm, which is read in the visitation of
the sick; which says, &lsquo;O God, thou hast taught me from my youth:
and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.&nbsp; Now also when
I am old and grey-headed, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed
thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is
to come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was, moreover, a Rechabite priest, we are told - &lsquo;one of
the sons of the Rechabim spoken of by Jeremiah the prophet&rsquo; -
who when the Jews were stoning St. James the Just, one of the twelve
apostles, cried out against their wickedness.</p>
<p>What befell the Rechabites when Jerusalem was destroyed, we know
not: but they seem to have returned to their old life, and wandered
away into the far east; for in the twelfth century, more than one thousand
years after, a Jewish traveller met with them 100,000 strong under a
Jewish prince of the house of David; still abstaining from wine and
flesh, and paying tithes to teachers who studied the law, and wept for
the fall of Jerusalem.&nbsp; And even yet they are said to endure and
prosper.&nbsp; For in our own time, a traveller met the Rechabites once
more in the heart of Arabia, still living in their tents, still calling
themselves the sons of Jonadab.&nbsp; With one of them, Mousa (<i>i.e</i>.
Moses) by name, he talked, and Mousa said to him, &lsquo;Come, and I
will show you who we are;&rsquo; and from an Arabic bible he read the
words of my text, and said, &lsquo;You will find us 60,000 in number
still.&nbsp; See, the words of the prophet have been fulfilled - &ldquo;Jonadab
the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>What lesson shall we learn from this story - so strange, and yet
so beautiful?&nbsp; What lesson need we learn, save that which the Holy
Scripture itself bids us learn?&nbsp; The blessing which comes upon
reverence for our forefathers, and above all for God, our Father in
Heaven.</p>
<p>Reverence for our forefathers.&nbsp; These are days in which we are
too apt to sneer at those who have gone before us; to look back on our
forefathers as very ignorant, prejudiced, old-fashioned people, whose
opinions have been all set aside by the progress of knowledge.</p>
<p>Be sure that in this temper of mind lies a sin and a snare.&nbsp;
If we wish to keep up true independence and true self-respect in ourselves
and our children, we should be careful to keep up respect for our forefathers.&nbsp;
A shallow, sneering generation, which laughs at those who have gone
before it, is ripe for disaster and slavery.&nbsp; We are not bound,
of course - as those old Rechabites considered themselves bound - to
do in everything exactly what our forefathers did.&nbsp; For we are
not under the law, but under grace; and where the Spirit of the Lord
is, there is liberty - liberty to change, improve, and develop as the
world grows older, and (we may hope) wiser.&nbsp; But we are bound to
do, not exactly what our forefathers did, but what we may reasonably
suppose that they would have done, had they lived now, and were they
in our places.&nbsp; We are to obey them, not in the letter, but in
the spirit.</p>
<p>And whenever, in the prayer for the Church militant, we commemorate
the faithful dead, and thank God for all his servants departed this
life in his faith and fear, we should remember with honest pride that
we are thanking God for our own mothers and fathers, and for those that
went before them; ay, for every honest God-fearing man and woman, high
or low, who ever did their duty by God and their neighbours, and left,
when they died, a spot of this land somewhat better than they found
it.</p>
<p>And for God; the Father of all fathers; our Father in heaven - Oh,
my friends, God grant that it may never be said to any of us, Behold
the words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, which he commanded his children,
are performed: but ye have not hearkened unto me.&nbsp; I have sent
also unto you, saith God, not merely my servants the prophets, but my
only-begotten, Jesus Christ your Lord, saying, &lsquo;Return you now
every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after
other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have
given to you and to your fathers.&nbsp; But ye have not inclined your
ear, nor hearkened unto me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>God grant that that may never be said to any of us.&nbsp; And yet
it is impossible to deny - impossible to shut our eyes to the plain
fact - that Englishmen now-a-days are more and more forgetting that
there are any commandments of God whatsoever; any everlasting laws laid
down by their Heavenly Father, which, if they break, will avenge themselves
by our utter ruin.&nbsp; We do not go after other gods, it is true,
in the sense of worshipping idols.&nbsp; But there is another god, which
we go after more and more; and that is money; gain; our interest (as
we call it):- not knowing that the only true interest of any man is
to fear God and keep his commandments.&nbsp; We hold more and more that
a man can serve God and mammon; that a man must of course be religious,
and belong to some special sect, or party, or denomination, and stand
up for that fiercely enough: but we do not hold that there are commandments
of God which say for ever to the sinner, &lsquo;Do this and thou shalt
live;&rsquo; &lsquo;Do this or thou shalt die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We hold that because we are not under the law, but under grace, there
is no condemnation for sin - at least for the special sort of sin which
happens to be in fashion, which is now-a-days the sin of making money
at all risks.&nbsp; We hold that there is one law of morality for the
kingdom of heaven, and another for the kingdom of mammon.&nbsp; Therefore
we hold, more and more, that when money is in question anything and
everything is fair.&nbsp; There are - we have reason to know it just
now but too well - thousands who will sell their honour, their honesty,
yea, their own souls, for a few paltry pounds, and think no shame.&nbsp;
And if any one says, with Jeremiah the prophet, &lsquo;These are poor,
they know not the way of the Lord, nor the judgment of their God.&nbsp;
I will get me to the great men, for they have known the way of the Lord,
and the judgment of their God:&rsquo; - then will he find, as Jeremiah
did, that too many of these great and wealthy worshippers of mammon
have utterly broken the yoke, and burst the bonds, of all moral law
of right and wrong: heaping up vast fortunes amid the ruin of those
who have trusted them, and the tears of the widow and the orphan, by
means now glossed over by fine new words, but called in plain honest
old English by a very ugly name.</p>
<p>How many there are in England now, my friends, who would laugh in
their hearts at those worthy Rechabites, and hold them to be ignorant,
old-fashioned, bigoted people, for keeping up their poor, simple, temperate
life, wandering to and fro with their tents and cattle, instead of dwelling
in great cities, and making money, and becoming what is now-a-days called
civilized, in luxury and covetousness.&nbsp; Surely according to the
wisdom of this world, the Rechabites were foolish enough.&nbsp; But
it is the wisdom of this world itself - not simplicity and loyalty like
theirs - which is foolishness with God.</p>
<p>My friends, let us all take warning, each man for himself.&nbsp;
When a nation corrupts itself - as we seem inclined to do now, by luxury
and covetousness, selfishness and self-will, forgetting more and more
loyalty and order, honesty and high principle - then some wholesome,
but severe judgment of God, is sure to come upon that nation: a day
in which all faces shall gather blackness: a day of gloominess and thick
darkness, like the morning spread upon the mountains.</p>
<p>For the eternal laws of God&rsquo;s providence are still at work,
though we choose to forget them; and the Judge who administers them
is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever, even Jesus Christ the Lord,
the everlasting Rock, on which all morality and all society is founded.&nbsp;
Whosoever shall fall on that Rock in repentance and humility, confessing,
bewailing, and forsaking his worldliness and sinfulness, he shall indeed
be broken: but of him it is written, &lsquo;The sacrifices of God are
a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not
despise.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he shall find that Rock, even Christ, a safe
standing-ground amid the slippery mire of this world&rsquo;s temptations,
and the storms and floods of trouble which are coming - it may be in
our children&rsquo;s days - it may be in our own.</p>
<p>But he who hardens his heart: he who says proudly, &lsquo;We are
they that ought to speak; who is Lord over us?&rsquo; - he who says
carelessly, &lsquo;Soul, take thine ease; thou hast much goods laid
up for many years&rsquo; - he who halts between two opinions, and believes
to the last that he can serve both God and mammon - he, especially,
who fancies that falsehood, injustice, covetousness, and neglect of
his fellow-men, can properly be his interest, or help his interest in
any wise - of all such it is written, &lsquo;On whomsoever that Rock&rsquo;
- even the eternal laws of Christ the Judge - &lsquo;On whomsoever that
Rock shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.&rsquo;</p>

<h2>SERMON VII. - THE NAME OF GOD</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>ISAIAH l. 10.</p>
<p>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of
his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light?&nbsp; Let
him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.</p>
<p>To some persons it may seem strange advice to tell them, that in
the hour of darkness, doubt, and sorrow, they will find no comfort like
that of meditating on the Name of the Ever-blessed Trinity.&nbsp; Yet
there is not a prophet or psalmist of the Old Testament who does not
speak of &lsquo;The Name of the Lord,&rsquo; as a kind of talisman against
all the troubles which can befall the spirit of man.&nbsp; And we, as
Christians, know, or ought to know, far more of God than did even prophets
or psalmists.&nbsp; If they found comfort in the name of God, we ought
to find far more.</p>
<p>But some will say - Yes.&nbsp; Let us think of God, God&rsquo;s mercies,
God&rsquo;s dealings with his people; but why think especially of the
Name of the Ever-blessed Trinity?</p>
<p>For this simple reason.&nbsp; That it is by that Name of Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, that God has revealed himself.&nbsp; That is the
name by which he bids us think of him; and we are more or less disregarding
his commands when we think of him by any other.&nbsp; That is the name
which God has given himself; and, therefore, it is morally certain that
that is God&rsquo;s right name; that it expresses God&rsquo;s very self,
God&rsquo;s very being, as he is.</p>
<p>Theology signifies, the knowledge of God as he is.&nbsp; And it is
dying out among us in these days.&nbsp; Much of what is called theology
now is nothing but experimental religion; which is most important and
useful when it is founded on the right knowledge of God: but which is
not itself theology.&nbsp; For theology begins with God: but experimental
religion, right or wrong, begins with a man&rsquo;s own soul.&nbsp;
Therefore it is that men are unaccustomed to theology.&nbsp; They shrink
from it as something very abstruse, only fit for great scholars and
divines, and almost given up now-a-days even by them.&nbsp; They do
not know that theology, the knowledge of God, is full of practical every-day
comfort, and guidance for their conduct and character; yea, that it
is - so says the Bible - everlasting life itself.&nbsp; Therefore it
is that some shrink from thinking of the Ever-blessed Trinity, not from
any evil intent, but because they are afraid of thinking wrongly, and
so consider it more safe not to think at all.&nbsp; They have been puzzled,
it may be, by arguments which they have heard, or read, or which have
risen up in their own minds, and which have made them doubt about the
Trinity: and they say - I will not torment my soul, and perhaps endanger
my soul, by doubts.&nbsp; I will take the doctrine of the Trinity for
granted, because I am bidden to do so: but I leave what it means to
be explained by wiser men.&nbsp; If I begin thinking about it I shall
only confuse myself.&nbsp; So it is better for me not to think at all.</p>
<p>And one cannot deny that they are right, as far as they go.&nbsp;
If they cannot think about the Trinity without thinking wrongly, it
is better to take on trust what they are told about it.&nbsp; But they
lose much by so doing.&nbsp; They lose the solid and real comfort which
they may get by thinking of the Name of God.&nbsp; And, I believe, they
lose it unnecessarily.&nbsp; I cannot see why they must think wrongly
of the Trinity, if they think at all.&nbsp; I cannot see why they need
confuse themselves.&nbsp; The doctrine of the Trinity is not really
an unreasonable one.&nbsp; The doubts which come into men&rsquo;s minds
concerning it do not seem to me sound and reasonable doubts.&nbsp; For
instance, some say - How can there be three persons in one God?&nbsp;
It is contrary to reason.&nbsp; One cannot be many.&nbsp; Three cannot
be one.&nbsp; That is unreasonable.</p>
<p>I think, that if you will use your reason for yourselves, you will
see that it is those words which are unreasonable, and not the doctrine
of the Trinity.</p>
<p>First.&nbsp; A thing need not be unreasonable - that is, contrary
to reason - because it is above and beyond reason - or, at least, beyond
our human reason, which at best (as St. Paul says) sees as in a glass
darkly, and only knows in part.</p>
<p>Consider how many things are beyond reason which are not contrary
to it.&nbsp; I say that all things which God has made are so: but, without
going so far, let us consider these simple examples.</p>
<p>Is it not beyond all reason that among animals, like should bring
forth like?&nbsp; Why does an eagle&rsquo;s egg always produce an eagle,
and a dove&rsquo;s egg a dove, and so forth?&nbsp; No man knows, no
man can give any reason whatsoever.&nbsp; If a dove&rsquo;s egg produced
an eagle, ignorant men would cry out at the wonder, the miracle.&nbsp;
Wise men know that the real wonder, the real miracle is, that a dove&rsquo;s
egg always produces a dove, and not any and every other bird.</p>
<p>Here is a common and notorious fact, entirely above our reason.&nbsp;
There is no cause to be given for it, save that God has ordained it
so.&nbsp; But it is not contrary to our reason.&nbsp; So far from it,
we are certain that a dove will produce a dove; and our reason has found
out much of the laws of kind; and found out that they are reasonable
laws, regular, and to be depended upon; so that we can, as all know,
produce and keep up new breeds whether of plants or of animals.</p>
<p>So that the law of kind, though it is beyond our reason, is not contrary
to our reason at all.</p>
<p>So much for things which have life.&nbsp; Take an equally notorious
example from things which have not life.</p>
<p>Is it not above and beyond all our reason - that the seemingly weakest
thing in the world, the most soft and yielding, the most frail and vanishing,
should be also one of the strongest things in the world?&nbsp; That
is so utterly above reason, that while I say it, it seems to some of
you to be contrary to reason, to be unreasonable and impossible.&nbsp;
It is so above reason, that till two hundred years ago, no one suspected
that it was true.&nbsp; And yet it is strictly true.</p>
<p>What is more soft and yielding, more frail and vanishing, than steam?&nbsp;
And what is stronger than steam?&nbsp; I know nothing.&nbsp; Steam it
is which has lifted up the mountains from the sea into the clouds.&nbsp;
Steam it is which tears to pieces the bowels of the earth with earthquakes
and volcanoes, shaking down cities, rasping the solid rocks into powder,
and scattering them far and wide in dust over the face of the land.</p>
<p>What gives to steam its enormous force is beyond our reason.&nbsp;
We do not know.&nbsp; But so far from being contrary to our reason,
we have learnt that the laws of steam are as reasonable as any other
of God&rsquo;s laws.&nbsp; We can calculate its force, we can make it,
use it, and turn its mighty powers, by reason and science, into our
most useful and obedient slave, till it works ten thousand mills, and
sends ten thousand ships across the sea.</p>
<p>Above reason, I say, but not contrary to reason, is the mighty power
of steam.</p>
<p>And God, who made all these wonders - and millions of wonders more
- must he not be more wonderful than them all?&nbsp; Must not his being
and essence be above our reason?&nbsp; But need they be, therefore,
contrary to our reason?&nbsp; Not so.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some will say, How can one be many?&nbsp; How can one
be three?&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; Two are one in you, and every man.&nbsp;
Your body is you, and your soul is you.&nbsp; They are two.&nbsp; But
you know yourself that you are one being; that the Athanasian Creed
speaks, at least, reason when it says, &lsquo;As the reasonable soul
and the flesh are one man, so God and man is one Christ.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And three are one in every plant in the field.&nbsp; Root, bark,
leaves, are three.&nbsp; And yet - they are one tree; and if you take
away any one of them, the tree will die.&nbsp; So it is in all nature.&nbsp;
But why do I talk of a tree, or any other example?&nbsp; Wherever you
look you find that one thing is many things, and many things one.&nbsp;
So far from that fact being contrary to our reason, it is one which
our reason (as soon as we think deeply about this world) assures us
is most common.&nbsp; Of every organized body it is strictly true, that
it is many things, bound together by a certain law, which makes them
one thing and no more.&nbsp; And, therefore, every organized body is
a mystery, and above reason: but its organization is none the less true
for that.</p>
<p>And there are philosophers who will tell you - and wisely and well
- that there must needs be some such mystery in God; that reason ought
to teach us - even if revelation had not - two things.&nbsp; First,
that God must be one; and next, that God must be many - that is, more
than one.</p>
<p>Do I mean that our own reason would have found out for itself the
mystery of the ever-blessed Trinity?&nbsp; God forbid!&nbsp; Nothing
less.</p>
<p>There surely is a difference between knowing that a thing must be,
and knowing that the thing is, and what it is like; and there surely
is a difference between knowing that there is a great mystery and wonder
in God, and knowing what that mystery is.</p>
<p>Man might have found out that God was one, and yet more than one;
but could he have found out what is the essence and character of God?&nbsp;
Not his own reason, but the Spirit of God it is which tells him that:
tells him that God is Three in One - that these three are persons -
that these persons are, a Father, a Son, and a Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>This is what God has himself condescended to tell us; and therefore
this is what he specially wishes us to believe and remember when we
think of him.&nbsp; This is God&rsquo;s name for himself - Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Man may give God what name he chooses.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s
own name, which he has given himself, is likely surely to be the most
correct: at least, it is the one of which God means us to think; for
it is the one into which he commanded us to be baptized.&nbsp; Remember
that, whenever you hear discourse concerning God; and if any man, however
learned, says that God is absolute, answer - &lsquo;It may be so: but
I was not baptized into the name of the absolute.&rsquo;&nbsp; If he
tell you, God is infinite, answer - &lsquo;It may be so: but I was not
baptized into the name of the infinite.&rsquo;&nbsp; If he tell you,
God is the first cause, answer - &lsquo;That I doubt not: but I was
not baptized into the name of the first cause.&nbsp; I was baptized
into the name which God has given himself - Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;
and I will give him no other name, and think of him by no other name,
lest I be committing an act of irreverence toward God, by presuming
to call him one thing, when he has bid me call him another.&nbsp; Absolute,
infinite, first cause, and so forth, are deep words: but they are words
of man&rsquo;s invention, and words too which plain, hard-working, hard-sorrowing
folks do not understand; even if learned men do - which I doubt very
much indeed: and therefore I do not trust them, cannot find comfort
for my soul in them.&nbsp; But Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are words
which plain, hard-working, hard-sorrowing men can understand, and can
trust, and can find comfort in them; for they are God&rsquo;s own words,
and, like all God&rsquo;s words, go straight home to the hearts of men
- straight home to the heart of every one who is a father or mother
- to the heart of every one who has a parent or a child - to the heart
of every one who has the Holy Spirit of God putting into his mind good
desires, and striving to make him bring them into good effect, and be,
what he knows he should be, a holy and good man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Answer thus, my friends.&nbsp; And think thus of the mystery of the
Ever-blessed Trinity.&nbsp; For this is a thoroughly reasonable plan
of thought: and more - in thinking thus you will find comfort, guidance,
clearness of head, and clearness of conscience also.&nbsp; Only remember
what you are to think of.&nbsp; You are not to think merely of the mystery
of the question, and to puzzle yourselves with arguments as to how the
Three Persons are one; for that is not to think of the Ever-blessed
Trinity, but only to think about it.&nbsp; Still less are you to think
of the Ever-blessed Trinity under names of philosophy which God has
not given to himself; for that is not to think of the Ever-blessed Trinity
at all.&nbsp; You must think of the Ever-blessed Trinity as he is, -
of a Father, a Son, and a Holy Spirit; and to think of him the more
earnestly, the more you are sad at heart.&nbsp; It may be that God has
sent that sadness to make you think of him.&nbsp; It may be that God
has cut the very ground from under your feet that you may rest on him,
the true and only ground of all created things; as it is written: &lsquo;Who
is he among you who walketh in darkness and hath no light?&nbsp; Let
him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some will tell you, that if you are sorrowful it is a time for self-examination,
and for thinking of your own soul.&nbsp; I answer - In good time, but
not yet.&nbsp; Think first of God; for how can you ever know anything
rightly about your own soul unless you first know rightly concerning
God, in whom your soul lives, and moves, and has its being?</p>
<p>Others may tell you to think of God&rsquo;s dealings with his people.&nbsp;
I answer - In good time, but not yet; think first of God.&nbsp; For
how can you rightly understand God&rsquo;s dealings, unless you first
rightly understand who God is, and what his character is?&nbsp; Right
notions concerning your own soul, right notions concerning God&rsquo;s
dealings, can only come from right notions concerning God himself.&nbsp;
He is before all things.&nbsp; Think of him before all things.&nbsp;
He is the first, and he is the last.&nbsp; Think of him first in this
life, and so you will think of him last, and for ever in the life to
come.&nbsp; Think of the Father, that he is a Father indeed, in spirit
and in truth.&nbsp; Think of the Son, that he is a Son indeed, in spirit
and in truth.&nbsp; Think of the Holy Spirit, that he is a Holy Spirit
indeed, in spirit and in truth.&nbsp; So you will be thinking indeed
of the Ever-blessed Trinity; and will worship God, not with your lips
or your thoughts merely, but in spirit and in truth.&nbsp; Think of
the Father, that he is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that
the perfect Son must be forever perfectly like the perfect Father.&nbsp;
For then you will believe that God the Father looks on you, and feels
for you, exactly as does Jesus Christ your Lord; then you will feel
that he is a Father indeed; and will enter more and more into the unspeakable
comfort of that word of all words, &lsquo;Our Father who art in heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Think of the Lord Jesus Christ as the perfect Son, who, though he
is co-equal and co-eternal with his Father, yet came not to do his own
will, but his Father&rsquo;s; who instead of struggling, instead of
helping himself, cried in his agony: &lsquo;Not my will, but thine be
done;&rsquo; and conquered by resignation.&nbsp; So you will enter into
the unspeakable comfort of conquering by resignation, as you see that
your resignation is to be like the resignation of Christ; not that of
trembling fear like a condemned criminal before a judge; not that of
sullen necessity, like a slave before his master: but that of the only-begotten
Son of God; the resignation of a child to the will of a father whom
he can utterly trust, because that father&rsquo;s name is love.</p>
<p>Think of the Holy Spirit as a person; having a will of his own; who
breatheth whither he listeth, and cannot be confined to any feelings
or rules of yours, or of any man&rsquo;s; but may meet you in the Sacraments,
or out of the Sacraments, even as he will; and has methods of comforting
and educating you, of which you will never dream; one whose will is
the same as the will of the Father and of the Son, even a good will;
just as his character is the same as the character of the Father and
of the Son: even love which works by holiness; love which you can trust
utterly, for yourself and for all whom you love.</p>
<p>Think, I say, of God himself as he is; think of his name, by which
he has revealed himself, and thus you will - But who am I, to pretend
to tell you what you will learn by thinking rightly of Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost?&nbsp; How can I dare to say how much you will or will
not learn?&nbsp; How can I put bounds to God&rsquo;s teaching? to the
workings of him who has said, &lsquo;If a man love me, he will keep
my words, and my Father will love him; and we will come unto him, and
make our abode with him&rsquo;?&nbsp; How can I tell you in a few words
of one sermon all that that means?&nbsp; How can I, or any man, know
all that that means?&nbsp; Who is one man, or all men, to exhaust the
riches of the glory of God, or the blessings which may come from thinking
of God&rsquo;s glory?&nbsp; Let it be enough for us to be sure that
truly to know God is everlasting life; and that the more we think of
God by his own revealed name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the more
we shall enter, now and hereafter, into eternal life, and into the peace
which comes by the true knowledge of him in whom we live, and move,
and have our being.</p>

<h2>SERMON VIII. - THE END OF RELIGION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>EPHESIANS iv. 23, 24.</p>
<p>Be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and put ye on the new man,
which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.</p>
<p>This text is exceedingly valuable to us for it tells us the end and
aim of all religion.&nbsp; It tells us why we are to pray, whether at
home or in church; why we are to read our Bibles and good books; why
we are to be what is commonly called religious.</p>
<p>It tells us, I say, the end and aim of all religion; namely, that
we may put on &lsquo;the new man, which after God&rsquo; - according
to the likeness of God - &lsquo;is created in righteousness and true
holiness.&rsquo;&nbsp; So says St. Paul in another place: &lsquo;Be
ye therefore followers&rsquo; - literally, copiers, imitators - &lsquo;of
God, as dear children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now this is not what you will be told from too many pulpits, and
in too many books, now-a-days, is the end of religion.&nbsp; You will
be told that the end of religion is to save your soul, and go to heaven.</p>
<p>But experience shows, my friends, in all religions and in all ages,
that those who make it their first object in life to save their souls,
are but too likely to lose them; as our Lord says, He that saveth his
soul, or life - for the words are the same in Scripture - shall lose
it.</p>
<p>And experience shows that in all religions, and in all ages, those
who make it their first object in life to get to heaven, are but too
likely never to get there: because in their haste, they forget what
heaven is, and what is the only way of arriving at it.</p>
<p>Good works, as they call the likeness of God and the Divine life,
are in too many persons&rsquo; eyes only fruits of faith, or proofs
of faith, and not the very end of faith, and of religion - ay, of their
very existence here on earth; and therefore they naturally begin to
ask, - How few good works will be enough to prove their faith?&nbsp;
And when a man has once set that question before himself, he is sure
to find a comfortable answer, and to discover that very few good works
indeed, - a very little sanctification (as it is called), a very little
righteousness, and a very little holiness, - will be enough to save
his soul, as far at least as he wishes his soul to be saved.&nbsp; My
friends, all this springs from that selfish view of religion which is
gaining power among us more and more.&nbsp; Christ came to deliver us
from our selfishness; from being slaves to our selfish prudence and
selfish interest.&nbsp; But we make religion a question of profit and
loss, as we make everything else.&nbsp; We ask - What shall I get by
being good?&nbsp; What shall I get by worshipping God?&nbsp; Is it not
prudent, and self-interested, and business-like to give up a little
pleasure on earth, in the hope of getting a great deal in heaven?&nbsp;
Is not religion a good investment?&nbsp; Is it not, considering how
short and uncertain life is, the best of all life-insurances?</p>
<p>My friends, we who have to earn our bread and to take honest money
for honest work, know well enough what trouble we have to keep out of
our daily life that mean, base spirit of self-interest, rather than
of duty, which never asks of anything, &lsquo;Is it right?&rsquo; but
only &lsquo;Will it pay me?&rsquo; - which, instead of thinking, How
can I do this work as well as possible? is perpetually thinking, How
can I get most money for the least work?&nbsp; We have to fight against
that spirit in worldly matters.&nbsp; For we know, that if we yield
to it, - if we sacrifice our duty to our pleasure or our gain, - it
is certain to make us do something mean, covetous, even fraudulent,
in the eyes of God and man.</p>
<p>But if we carry that spirit into religion, and our spiritual and
heavenly duties; if we forget that that is the spirit of the world;
if we forget that we renounced the world at our baptism, and that we
therefore promised not to shape our lives by <i>its</i> rules and maxims;
if our thought is, not of whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things
are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, of good report, whatsoever brings
us true honour and deserved praise from God and from man; if we think
only that intensely selfish and worldly thought, How much will God take
for saving my soul? - which is the secret thought (alas that it should
be so!) of too many of all denominations, - then we shall be in a fair
way of killing our souls; so that if they be saved, they will not at
all events be saved alive.&nbsp; For we shall kill in our souls just
those instincts of purity, justice, generosity, mercy, love, in one
word, of unselfishness and unworldliness, which make the very life of
the soul, because they are inspired by the Spirit of God, even the Holy
Ghost.&nbsp; And we shall be but too likely not to sit in heavenly places
with Christ Jesus - as St. Paul tells us we may do even in this life:
but to go to our own place - wherever that may be - with selfish Judas,
who when he found that his Saviour was not about to restore the kingdom
to Israel, and make a great prince of him there and then, made the best
investment he could, under the danger which he saw at hand, by selling
his Lord for thirty pieces of silver: to remain to all time a warning
to those who are religious for self-interest&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>What, then, is the end and aim of true Religion?&nbsp; St. Paul tells
us in the text.&nbsp; The end and aim, he says, of hearing Christ, the
end and aim of learning the truth as it is in Jesus, is this - that
we may be renewed in the spirit of our minds, and put on the new man,
which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.&nbsp;
To put on the new man; the new pattern of manhood, which is after the
pattern of the Son of man, Jesus Christ, and therefore after the pattern
and likeness of God.&nbsp; To be followers, that is, copiers and imitators
of God, that (so says St. Paul) is the end and aim of religion.&nbsp;
In one word, we are to be good; and religion, according to St. Paul,
is neither more nor less than the act of becoming good, like the good
God.</p>
<p>To be like God.&nbsp; Can we have any higher and more noble aim than
that?&nbsp; And yet it is a simple aim.&nbsp; There is nothing fantastic,
fanatical, inhuman about it.&nbsp; It is within our reach - within the
reach of every man and woman; within the reach of the poorest, the most
unlearned.&nbsp; For how does St. Paul tell us that we can become like
God?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wherefore,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;putting away lying, speak
every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.&nbsp;
Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: neither
give place to the devil.&nbsp; Let him that stole steal no more: but
rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good,
that he may have to give to him that needeth.&nbsp; Let no corrupt communication
proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying,
that it may minister grace unto the hearers.&nbsp; And grieve not the
Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.&nbsp;
Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking,
be put away from you, with all malice: and be ye kind one to another,
tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ&rsquo;s
sake hath forgiven you.</p>
<p>Do that, he says, and you will be followers of God, as dear children;
and thus will you surely save your souls alive.&nbsp; For they will
be inspired by the Spirit of God, the spirit of goodness, who is the
Lord and Giver of life; wherefore they cannot decay nor die, but must
live and grow, develop and improve perpetually, becoming better and
wiser, - and therefore more useful to their fellow-creatures, more blessed
in themselves, and more pleasing to God their Father, through all eternity.&nbsp;
And thus you will surely go to heaven.&nbsp; For heaven will begin on
earth, and last on after this earth, and all that binds you to this
earth, has vanished in the grave.</p>
<p>Heaven will begin on earth, I say.&nbsp; When St. Paul told these
very Ephesians to whom my text was addressed, that God had made them
sit, even then, in heavenly places with Christ Jesus, he did not mean
in any wise - what they would have known was not true - that their bodies
had been miraculously lifted up above the earth, above the clouds, or
elsewhere: no, for he had told them before, in the first chapter, what
he meant by heavenly places.&nbsp; God their Father, he says, had blessed
them with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places, in Christ, in
that He had chosen them in Christ before the foundation of the world
- and for what end?&nbsp; For the very end which I have been preaching
to you.&nbsp; &lsquo;That they should be holy, and without blame before
God, in Love.&rsquo;&nbsp; That was heaven.&nbsp; If they were that,
- holy, blameless, loving, they were in heavenly places already, - in
that moral and spiritual heaven in which God abides for ever.&nbsp;
They were with God, and with all who are like God, as it is written,
&lsquo;He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My dear friends, this is the heaven for which we are all to strive
- a heaven of goodness, wherein God dwells.&nbsp; And therefore an eternal
and everlasting heaven, as eternal as goodness and as eternal as God
himself; and if we are living in it, we have all we need.&nbsp; But
we may begin to live in it here.&nbsp; To what particular place our
souls go after death, Scripture does not tell us, and we need not know.&nbsp;
To what particular place our souls and bodies go after the resurrection,
Scripture tells us not, and we need not know.&nbsp; But this Scripture
tells us, and that is enough for us, that they will be in heavenly places,
in the presence of Christ and of God.&nbsp; And this Scripture tells
us - and indeed our own conscience and reason tell us likewise - that
though death may alter our place, it cannot alter our character; though
it may alter the circumstances round us, it cannot alter ourselves.&nbsp;
If we have been good and pure before death, we shall be good and pure
after death.&nbsp; If we have been led and inspired by God&rsquo;s Spirit
before death, so shall we be after death.&nbsp; If we have been in heavenly
places before death, thinking heavenly thoughts, feeling heavenly feelings,
and doing heavenly deeds, then we shall be in heavenly places after
death; for we shall have with us the Spirit of God, whose presence is
heaven; and as long as we are holy, good, pure, unselfish, just, and
merciful, we may be persuaded, with St. Paul, that wheresoever we go,
all will be well; for &lsquo;neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth,
nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of
God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SERMON IX. - THE HUMANITY OF GOD</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>ST. LUKE xv. 7.</p>
<p>I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner
that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need
no repentance.</p>
<p>There are three parables in this chapter: all agree in one quality
- in their humanity.&nbsp; God shows us in them that there is something
in his character which is like the best and simplest parts of our characters.&nbsp;
God himself likens himself to men, that men may understand him and love
him.</p>
<p>Why there should be more joy over the repenting sinner than over
the just man who needs no repentance, we cannot explain in words: but
our hearts tell us that it is true, beautiful; that it is reasonable,
though we can give no reason for it.&nbsp; You know that if you had
lost a sheep; if you had lost a piece of money; if you had had a child
run away from you, it would be far more pleasant to find that thing
which you had lost, than never to have lost it at all.&nbsp; You do
not know why.&nbsp; God tells you that it is a part of his image and
likeness in you; that you rejoice over what you have lost and found
again, because God rejoices over what he has lost and found again.</p>
<p>And is not this a gospel, and good news?&nbsp; Is it not good news
that we need never be afraid or ashamed to give way to our tenderness
and pity? for God does not think it beneath him to be tender and pitiful.&nbsp;
Is it not good news that we need never be afraid or ashamed to forgive,
to take back those who have neglected us, wronged us? for God does not
think it beneath him to do likewise.&nbsp; That we need never show hardness,
pride, sternness to our children when they do wrong, but should win
them by love and tenderness, caring for them all the more, the less
they care for themselves? for God does even so to us, who have sinned
against him far more than our children ever can sin against us.</p>
<p>And is it not good news, again, that God does care for sinners, and
for all kinds and sorts of sinners?&nbsp; Some go wrong from mere stupidity
and ignorance, because they know no better; because they really are
not altogether accountable for their own doings.&nbsp; They are like
the silly sheep, who gets out over the fence of his own fancy: and yet
no reasonable man will be angry with the poor thing.&nbsp; It knows
no better.&nbsp; How many a poor young thing goes wandering away, like
that silly sheep, and having once lost its way, cannot get back again,
but wanders on further and further, till it lies down all desperate,
tired out, mired in the bogs, and torn about with thorns!</p>
<p>Then the good shepherd does not wait for that sheep to come back.&nbsp;
He goes and seeks it far and wide, up hill and down dale, till he finds
it; and having found it, he does not beat it, rate it - not even drive
it home before him.&nbsp; It is tired and miserable.&nbsp; If it has
been foolish, it has punished itself enough for its folly; and all he
feels for it is pity and love.&nbsp; It wants rest, and he gives it
rest at his own expense.&nbsp; He lays it on his shoulders, and takes
it home, calling on all heaven and earth to rejoice with him.&nbsp;
Ah, my friends, if that is not the picture of a God whom you can love,
of a God whom you can trust, what God would you have?</p>
<p>Some, again, go wrong from ignorance and bad training, bad society,
bad education, bad example; and in other countries - though, thank God,
not in this - from bad laws and bad government.&nbsp; How many thousands
and hundreds of thousands are ruined, as it seems to us, thereby!&nbsp;
The child born in a London alley, reared up among London thieves, taught
to swear, lie, steal, never entering a school or church, never hearing
the name of God save in oaths - There is the lost piece of money.&nbsp;
It is a valuable thing; the King&rsquo;s likeness is stamped on it:
but it is useless, because it is lost, lying in the dust and darkness,
hidden in a corner, unable to help itself, and of no use to any one.&nbsp;
And so there is many a person, man and woman, who is worth something,
who has God&rsquo;s likeness on them, who, if they were brought home
to God, might be of good use in the world; but they are lost, from ignorance
and bad training.&nbsp; They lie in a corner in darkness, not knowing
their own value in God&rsquo;s eyes; not knowing that they bear his
image, though it be all crusted over with the dust and dirt of barbarism
and bad habits.&nbsp; Then Christ will go after them, and seek diligently
till he finds them, and cleanses them, and makes them bright, and of
good use again in his Church and his kingdom.&nbsp; They are worth something,
and Christ will not let them be wasted; he will send clergymen, teachers,
missionaries, schools, reformatories, penitentiaries, hospitals - ay,
and other messengers of his, of whom we never dream, for his ways are
as high above our ways as the heaven is above the earth: with all these
he sweeps his house, and his blessing is on them all, for by them he
finds the valuable coin which was lost.</p>
<p>But there is a third sort of sinner, spoken of in Christ&rsquo;s
next parable in this chapter, from which my text is taken, of whom it
is not said that God the Father sends out to seek and to save him.&nbsp;
That is the prodigal son, who left his father&rsquo;s house, and strayed
away of his own wantonness and free will.&nbsp; Christ does not go out
after him.&nbsp; He has gone away of his own will; and of his own will
he must come back: and he has to pay a heavy price for his folly - to
taste hunger, shame, misery, all but despair.&nbsp; For understand -
if any of you fancy that you can sin without being punished - that the
prodigal son is punished, and most severely.&nbsp; He does not get off
freely, the moment he chooses to repent, as false preachers will tell
you: even after he does repent, and resolves to go back to his father&rsquo;s
house, he has a long journey home, in poverty and misery, footsore,
hungry, and all but despairing.&nbsp; But when he does get home; when
he shows that he has learnt the bitter lesson; when all he dares to
ask is, &lsquo;Make me as one of thy hired servants,&rsquo; he is received
as freely as the rest.&nbsp; And it is worth while to remark, that our
Lord spends on him tenderer words than on those who are lost by mere
foolishness or ignorance.&nbsp; Of him it is not said, &lsquo;Rejoice
with me, for I have found him,&rsquo; - but, Bring out the best robe,
for this my son - not my sheep, not my piece of money, but my son -
was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.</p>
<p>In this is a great mystery; one of which one hardly dares to talk:
but one which one must think over in one&rsquo;s own heart, and say,
&lsquo;Oh the depth of the riches and of the knowledge and wisdom of
God!&nbsp; How wonderful are his judgments, and his ways past finding
out.&nbsp; For who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been
his counsellor?&nbsp; Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be
recompensed unto him again?&rsquo;&nbsp; Who indeed?&nbsp; God is not
a tyrant, who must be appeased with gifts; or a taskmaster, who must
be satisfied with the labour of his slaves.&nbsp; He is a father who
loves his children; who gives, and loveth to give; who gives to all
freely, and upbraideth not.&nbsp; He truly willeth not the death of
a sinner, but rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live.&nbsp;
His will is a good will; and howsoever much man&rsquo;s sin and folly
may resist it, and seem for a time to mar it, yet he is too great and
good to owe any man, even the worst, the smallest spite or grudge.&nbsp;
Patiently, nobly, magnanimously, God waits; waits for the man who is
a fool, to find out his own folly; waits for the heart which has tried
to find pleasure in everything else, to find out that everything else
disappoints, and to come back to him, the fountain of all wholesome
pleasure, the well-spring of all life fit for a man to live.&nbsp; When
the fool finds out his folly; when the wilful man gives up his wilfulness;
when the rebel submits himself to law; when the son comes back to his
father&rsquo;s house - there is no sternness, no peevishness, no up-braiding,
no pride, no revenge; but the everlasting and boundless love of God
wells forth again as rich as ever.&nbsp; He has condescended to wait
for his creature; because what he wanted was not his creature&rsquo;s
fear, but his creature&rsquo;s love; not his lip-obedience, but his
heart; because he wanted him not to come back as a trembling slave to
his master, but as a son who has found out at last what a father he
has left him, when all beside has played him false.&nbsp; Let him come
back thus; and then all is forgiven and forgotten; and all that will
be said will be, &lsquo;This my son was dead, and is alive again; he
was lost, and is found.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SERMON X. - GOD&rsquo;S WORLD</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(<i>Preached before the Prince of Wales, at Sandringham</i>, 1866.)</p>
<p>GENESIS i. 1.</p>
<p>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</p>
<p>It may seem hardly worth while to preach upon this text.&nbsp; Every
one thinks that he believes it.&nbsp; Of course - they say - we know
that God made the world.&nbsp; Teach us something we do not know, not
something which we do.&nbsp; Why preach to us about a text which we
fully understand, and believe already?</p>
<p>Because, my friends, there are few texts in the Bible more difficult
to believe than this, the very first; few texts which we need to repeat
to ourselves again and again, in all the chances and changes of this
mortal life; lest we should forget it just as we feel we are most sure
of it.</p>
<p>We know that it was very difficult for people in olden times to believe
it.&nbsp; Else why did all the heathens of old, and why do all heathens
now, worship idols?</p>
<p>We know that the old Jews, after it had been revealed to them, found
it very difficult to believe it.&nbsp; Else why were they always deserting
the worship of God, and worshipping idols and devils, sun, moon, and
stars, and all the host of heaven?</p>
<p>We know that the early Christians, in spite of the light of the Gospel
and of God&rsquo;s Spirit, found it very difficult to believe it.&nbsp;
Doubtless they believed it a thousand times more fully than it had ever
been believed before.&nbsp; They would have shrunk with horror from
saying that any one but God had made the heavens and the earth.&nbsp;
But Christians clung, for many hundred years, even almost up to our
own day, to old heathen superstitions, which they would have cast away
if their faith had been full, and if they had held with their whole
hearts and souls and minds, that there was one God, of whom are all
things.&nbsp; They believed that the Devil and evil spirits had power
to raise thunderstorms, and blight crops, and change that course of
nature of which the Psalmist had said, that all things served God, and
continued this day as at the beginning, for God had given them a law
which could not be broken.&nbsp; They believed in magic, and astrology,
and a hundred other dreams, which all began from secret disbelief that
God made the heaven and the earth; till they fancied that the Devil
could and would teach men the secrets of nature, and the way to be rich
and great, if they would but sell their souls to him.&nbsp; They believed,
in a word, the very atheistic lie which Satan told to our blessed Lord,
when he said that all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them
were his, and to whomsoever he would he gave them - instead of believing
our Lord&rsquo;s answer, &lsquo;Get thee behind me, Satan: it is written,
Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And therefore I tell you here - as the Church has told Christian
people in all ages - that if any of you have any fancy for such follies,
any belief in charms and magic, any belief that you can have your fortunes
told by astrologers, gipsies, or such like, you must go back to your
Bible, and learn better the first text in it.&nbsp; &lsquo;In the beginning
God created the heaven and the earth.&rsquo;&nbsp; God&rsquo;s is the
kingdom, and the power, and the glory, of all things visible and invisible;
all the world round us, with its wonderful secrets, is governed, from
the sun over our heads, to the smallest blade of grass beneath our feet,
by God, and by God alone, and neither evil spirit nor magician has the
smallest power over one atom of it; and our fortunes, in likewise, do
not depend on the influences of stars or planets, ghosts or spirits,
or anything else: but on ourselves, of whom it is written, that God
shall judge every man according to his works.</p>
<p>Even now, in these very days, many good people are hardly able, it
seems to me, to believe with their whole hearts that God made heaven
and earth.&nbsp; They half believe it: but their faith is weak; and
when it is tried, they grow frightened, and afraid of truth.&nbsp; This
it is which makes so many good people afraid of what is now called Science
- of all new discoveries about the making of this earth, and the powers
and virtues of the things about us; afraid of wonders which are become
matters of course among us, but of which our forefathers knew little
or nothing.&nbsp; They are afraid lest these things should shake people&rsquo;s
faith in the Bible, and in Christianity; lest men should give up the
good old faith of their forefathers, and fancy that the world is grown
too wise to believe in the old doctrines.&nbsp; One cannot blame them,
cannot even be surprised at them.&nbsp; So many wonderful truths (for
truths they are), of which our fathers never dreamed, are discovered
every year, that none can foretell where the movement will stop; what
we shall hear next; what we shall have to believe next.</p>
<p>Only, let us take refuge in the text - &lsquo;In the beginning God
created the heaven and the earth.&rsquo;&nbsp; All that we see around
us, however wonderful; all that has been found out of late, however
wonderful; all that will be ever found out, however still more wonderful
it may be, is the work of God; of that God who revealed himself to Moses;
of that God who led the children of Israel out of their slavery in Egypt;
of that God who taught David, in all his trouble and wanderings, to
trust in him as his guide and friend; of that God who revealed to the
old Prophets the fate of nations, and the laws by which he governs all
the kingdoms and people of the earth; of that God, above all, who so
loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that the world
by him might be saved.</p>
<p>This material world which we do see, is as much God&rsquo;s world
as the spiritual world we do not see.&nbsp; And, therefore, the one
cannot contradict the other; and the true understanding of the one will
never hurt our true understanding of the other.</p>
<p>But many good people have another fear, and that, I think, a far
more serious one.&nbsp; They are afraid, in consequence of all these
wonderful discoveries of science, that people will begin to trust in
science, and not in God.&nbsp; And that fear is but too well founded.&nbsp;
It is certain that if sinful man can find anything to trust in, instead
of God, trust therein he surely will.</p>
<p>The old Jews preferred to trust in idols, rather than God; the Christians
of the Middle Age, to their shame, trusted in magic and astrology, rather
than God; and after that, some 200 years ago, when men had grown too
wise to trust in such superstitions, they certainly did not grow wise
enough, most of them, to trust in the living God.&nbsp; They relied,
the rulers of the nations especially, in their own wit and cunning,
and tried to govern the world and keep it straight, by falsehood and
intrigue, envy and jealousy, plotting and party spirit, and the wisdom
which cometh not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish, - that
wisdom against which we pray, whenever we sing &lsquo;God save the Queen,&rsquo;
-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Confound their politics,<br />Frustrate their knavish tricks,<br />On
Thee our hopes we fix,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GOD save the Queen.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And since that false wisdom has failed, and the wisdom of this world,
and the rulers of this world, came to nought in the terrible crisis
of the French Revolution, eighty years ago, men have been taking up
a new idolatry.&nbsp; For as science has spread, they have been trusting
in science rather than in the living God, and giving up the old faith
that God&rsquo;s judgments are in all the earth, and that he rewards
righteousness and punishes iniquity; till too many seem to believe that
the world somehow made itself, and that there is no living God ordering
and guiding it; but that a man must help himself as he best can in this
world, for in God no help is to be found.</p>
<p>And how shall we escape that danger?</p>
<p>I do not think we shall escape it, if we stop short at the text.&nbsp;
We must go on from the Old Testament and let the New explain it.&nbsp;
We must believe what Moses tells us: but we must ask St. John to show
us more than Moses saw.&nbsp; Moses tells us that God created the heavens
and the earth; St. John goes further, and tells us what that God is
like; how he saw Christ, the Word of God, by whom all things were made,
and without whom nothing was made that is made.&nbsp; And what was he
like?&nbsp; He was the brightness of his Father&rsquo;s glory, and the
express image of his person.&nbsp; And what was that like? was there
any darkness in him - meanness, grudging, cruelty, changeableness, deceit?&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; He was full of grace and truth.&nbsp; Grace and truth: that
is what Christ is; and therefore that is what God is.</p>
<p>There was another aspect of him, true; and St. John saw that likewise.&nbsp;
And so awful was it that he fell at the Lord&rsquo;s feet as he had
been dead.</p>
<p>But the Lord was still full of grace and truth; still, however awful
he was, he was as full as ever of love, pity, gentleness.&nbsp; He was
the Lamb that was slain for the sins of the world, even though that
Lamb was in the midst of the throne from which came forth thunderings
and lightnings, and judgments against the sins of all the world.&nbsp;
Terrible to wrong, and to the doers of wrong: but most loving and merciful
to all true penitents, who cast themselves and the burden of their sins
before his feet; perfect justice and perfect Love, - that is God.&nbsp;
That is the maker of this world.&nbsp; That is he who in the beginning
made heaven and earth.&nbsp; An utterly good God.&nbsp; A God whose
mercy is over all his creatures.&nbsp; A God who desires the good of
his creatures; who willeth not that one little one should perish; who
will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth;
who wages everlasting war against sin and folly, and wrong and misery,
and all the ills to which men are heirs; who not only made the world,
but loves the world, and who proved that - what a proof! - by not sparing
his only-begotten Son, but freely giving him for us.</p>
<p>Therefore we can say, not merely, - I know that a God made the world,
but I know what that God is like.&nbsp; I know that he is not merely
a great God, a wise God, but a good God; that goodness is his very essence.&nbsp;
I know that he is gracious and merciful, long suffering, and of great
kindness.&nbsp; I know that he is loving to every man, and that his
mercy is over all his works.&nbsp; I know that he upholds those who
fall, and lifts up those who are down; I know that he careth for the
fatherless and widow, and executes judgment and justice for all those
who are oppressed with wrong.&nbsp; I know that he will fulfil the desire
of those who call upon him; and will also hear their cry and will help
them.&nbsp; I know, in short, that he is a living God, and a loving
God; a God in whom men may trust, to whom they may open their hearts,
as children to their father: and I am sure that those who come to him
he will in no wise cast out; for he himself has said, with human voice
upon this earth of ours, - &lsquo;Come unto me all ye that labour and
are heavy laden and I will give you rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In him all can trust.&nbsp; The sick man on his bed can trust in
him and say - In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth;
and he is full of grace and truth.&nbsp; This sickness of mine comes
by the laws of heaven and earth; and those laws are God&rsquo;s laws.&nbsp;
Then even this sickness may be full of grace and truth.&nbsp; It comes
by no blind chance, but by the will of him who so loved me, that he
stooped to die for me on the Cross.&nbsp; Christ my Lord and God has
some gracious and bountiful purpose in it, some lesson for me to learn
from it.&nbsp; I will ask him to teach me that lesson; and I trust in
him that he will teach me; and that, even for this sickness and this
sorrow, I shall have cause to thank him in the world to come.&nbsp;
Shall I not trust him who not only made this world, but so loved it
that he stooped to die for it upon the Cross?</p>
<p>The labourer and the farmer can trust in him, in the midst of short
crops and bad seasons, and say, In the beginning God created the heaven
and the earth; and he is full of grace and truth.&nbsp; Frost and blight
obey his commands as well as sunshine and plenty.&nbsp; He knows best
what ought to be.&nbsp; Shall we not trust in him, who not only made
this world, but so loved it, that he stooped to die for it upon the
Cross?</p>
<p>The scholar and the man of science, studying the wonders of this
earth, can trust in him, and say, In the beginning God created the heaven
and the earth; and he is full of grace and truth.&nbsp; Many things
puzzle me; and the more I learn the less I find I really know; but I
shall know as much as is good for me, and for mankind.&nbsp; God is
full of grace, and will not grudge me knowledge; and full of truth,
and will not deceive me.&nbsp; And I shall never go far wrong as long
as I believe, not only in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all
things visible and invisible, but in one Lord Jesus Christ, his only-begotten
Son, light of light, very God of very God, by whom all things were made,
who for us men and our salvation came down, and died, and rose again;
whose kingdom shall have no end; who rules over every star and planet,
every shower and sunbeam, every plant and animal and stone, every body
and every soul of man; who will teach men, in his good time and way,
all that they need know, in order to multiply and replenish the earth,
and subdue it in this life, and attain everlasting life in the world
to come.&nbsp; And for the rest, puzzled though I be, shall I not trust
him, who not only made this world, but so loved it, that he stooped
to die for it upon the Cross?</p>

<h2>SERMON XI. - THE ARMOUR OF GOD</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(<i>Preached before the Prince of Wales, at Sandringham, January</i>
20<i>th</i>, 1867.)</p>
<p>EPHESIANS vi. 11.</p>
<p>Put on the whole armour of God.</p>
<p>St. Paul again and again compares himself and the Christians to whom
he writes to soldiers, and their lives to warfare.&nbsp; And it was
natural that he should do so.&nbsp; Everywhere he went, in those days,
he would find Roman soldiers, ruling over men of different races from
themselves, and ruling them, on the whole, well.&nbsp; Greeks, Syrians,
Jews, Egyptians, - all alike in his days obeyed the Roman soldiers,
who had conquered the then known world.</p>
<p>And St. Paul and his disciples wished to conquer the world likewise.&nbsp;
The Roman soldier had conquered it for C&aelig;sar: St. Paul would conquer
it for Christ.&nbsp; The Roman soldier had used bodily force - the persuasion
of the sword.&nbsp; St. Paul would use spiritual force - the persuasion
of preaching.&nbsp; The Roman soldier wrestled against flesh and blood:
St. Paul wrestled against more subtle and dangerous enemies - spiritual
enemies, he calls them - who enslaved and destroyed the reason, and
conscience, and morals of men.</p>
<p>St. Paul and his disciples, I say, had set before themselves no less
a task than to conquer the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, he says, they must copy the Roman soldier, and put on
their armour, as he put on his.&nbsp; He took C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s armour,
and put on C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s uniform.&nbsp; They must take the armour
of God, that they may withstand in the evil day of danger and battle,
and having done all, - done their duty manfully as good soldiers, -
stand; keep their ranks, and find themselves at the end of the battle
not scattered and disorganized, but in firm and compact order, like
the Roman soldiers, who, by drill and discipline, had conquered the
irregular and confused troops of all other nations.</p>
<p>Let me, this morning, explain St. Paul&rsquo;s words to you, one
by one.&nbsp; We shall find them full of lessons - and right wholesome
lessons - for in this parable of the armour of God St. Paul sketches
what you and I and every man should be.&nbsp; He sketches the character
of a good man, a true man, a man after God&rsquo;s own heart.</p>
<p>First, the Christians are to gird their loins - to cover the lower
part of their body, which is the most defenceless.&nbsp; That the Roman
soldier did with a kilt, much like that which the Highlanders wear now.&nbsp;
And that garment was to be Truth.&nbsp; Truthfulness, honesty, that
was to be the first defence of a Christian man, instead of being, as
too many so-called Christians make it, the very last.&nbsp; Honesty,
before all other virtues, was to gird his very loins, was to protect
his very vitals.</p>
<p>The breastplate, which covered the upper part of the body, was to
be righteousness - which we now commonly call, justice.&nbsp; To be
a just man, after being first a truthful man, was the Christian&rsquo;s
duty.</p>
<p>And his helmet was to be the hope of Salvation - that is, of safety:
not merely of being saved in the next world - though of course St. Paul
includes that - but of being saved in this world; of coming safe through
the battle of life; of succeeding; of conquering the heathen round them,
and making them Christians, instead of being conquered by them.&nbsp;
The hope of safety was to be his helmet, to guard his head - the thinking
part.&nbsp; We all know how a blow on the head confuses and paralyses
a man, making him (as we say) lose his head.&nbsp; We know too, how,
in spiritual matters, terror and despair deal a deadly blow to a man&rsquo;s
mind, - how if a man expects to fail, he cannot think clearly and calmly,
- how often desperation and folly go hand in hand; for, if a man loses
hope, he is but too apt to lose his reason.&nbsp; The Christian&rsquo;s
helmet, then, - that which would save his head, and keep his mind calm,
prudent, strong, and active, - was the hope of success.</p>
<p>And for their feet - they must be shod with the preparation of the
Gospel of peace.</p>
<p>That is a grand saying, if you will remember that the key-word, which
explains it all, is Peace, and the Gospel, that is, the good news, thereof.</p>
<p>The Roman soldier had his preparation, which kept him prepared and
ready to march through the world; and of that St. Paul was thinking,
and had need to think; for he had heard the sound of it in every street,
on every high road, from Jerusalem to Ephesus, ever since he was a child
- the tramp of the heavy nailed boot which the Roman soldier always
wore.&nbsp; The Roman soldiers were proud of their boots, - so proud
that, in St. Paul&rsquo;s time, they nicknamed one of their royal princes
Caligula, because, as a boy in camp, he used to wear boots like the
common soldiers: and he bore that name when he became emperor, and bears
it to this day.&nbsp; And they had reason to be proud, after their own
notion of glory.&nbsp; For that boot had carried them through desert
and through cities, over mountain ranges, through trackless forests,
from Africa even into Britain here, to be the conquerors of the then
known world; and, wherever the tramp of that boot had been heard, it
had been the sound, not of the good news of peace, but of the evil news
of war.&nbsp; Isaiah of old, watching for the deliverance of the Jews
from captivity, heard in the spirit the footsteps of the messengers
coming with the news that Cyrus was about to send the Jews home to their
own land, and cried, &lsquo;How beautiful upon the mountains are the
feet of them that bring good tidings, that publish peace!&rsquo;&nbsp;
But the tramp of the Roman armies had as yet brought little but bad
tidings, and published destruction.&nbsp; Men slain in battle, women
and children driven off captive, villages burnt, towns sacked and ruined,
till wherever their armies passed - as one of their own writers has
said - they made a desert, and then called that peace.</p>
<p>So had the Roman soldier marched over the world, and conquered it.&nbsp;
And now Christ&rsquo;s soldiers were beginning their march over the
world, that they might conquer it by fulfilling Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy.&nbsp;
They were going forth, with their feet shod with the good news of Peace;
to treat all men, not as their enemies, not as their slaves, but as
their brothers; and to bring them good news, and bid them share in it,
- the good news that God was at peace with them, and that they might
now be at peace with their own consciences, and at peace with each other,
for all were brothers in Jesus Christ their Lord.</p>
<p>Shod with that good news of peace, these Christians were going to
conquer the world, and to penetrate into distant lands from which the
Roman armies had been driven back in shameful defeat.&nbsp; To penetrate,
too, where the Roman armies never cared to go, - among the miserable
and crowded lanes of the great cities, and conquer there what the Roman
armies could not conquer - the vice, the misery, the cruelty, the idolatry
of the heathen.</p>
<p>The shield, again, guarded those parts of the soldier which the armour
did not guard.&nbsp; It warded off the stones, arrows, and darts - fiery
darts often, as St. Paul says, which were hurled at him from afar.&nbsp;
And the Christian&rsquo;s shield, St. Paul says, was to be Faith, -
trust in God, - belief that he was fighting God&rsquo;s battle, and
not his own; belief that God was over him in the battle, and would help
and guide him, and give him strength to do his work.&nbsp; To believe
firmly that he was in the right, and on God&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; To believe
that, when he was wounded and struck down, - when men deserted him,
cursed him, tried to take his life - perhaps did take his life - with
torments unspeakable, - to have faith to say in his heart, &lsquo;I
am in the right.&rsquo;&nbsp; When he was writhing under the truly fiery
darts of misrepresentation, slander, scorn, or under the equally fiery
darts of remorse for his own mistakes, his own weaknesses, still to
say after all, &lsquo;I am in the right.&rsquo;&nbsp; That shield of
faith, though it might not save him from wounds, torturing wounds, perhaps
crippling wounds, would at least save his life, - at least protect his
vitals; and, when he seemed stricken to the very earth, he could still
shelter himself under that shield of faith, and cry, &lsquo;Rejoice
not against me, O mine enemy; when I fall, I shall arise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And they were to take a sword.&nbsp; They were to use only one weapon,
as the Roman soldier used but one.&nbsp; For, though he went into battle
armed with a short heavy pike, he hurled it at once against the enemy;
then he closed in with his sword, and fought the real battle with that
alone, hand to hand, and knee to knee.&nbsp; The short Roman sword,
used by brave men in close fight, had defeated all the weapons of all
the nations.&nbsp; St. Paul knew that fact, as well as we; and I cannot
but suppose that he had it in his mind when he wrote these great words,
and that he meant to bid Christians, when they fought God&rsquo;s battle,
to fight, like the Romans, hand to hand: not to indulge in cowardly
stratagems, intrigues, and lawyers&rsquo; quibbles, fighting like the
barbarians, cowardly and afar off, hurling stones, and shooting clouds
of arrows, but to grapple with their enemies, looking them boldly in
the face, as honest men should do, trying their strength against them
fairly, and striking them to the heart.&nbsp; But with what?&nbsp; With
that sword which, if it wound, heals likewise, - if it kills, also makes
alive; the sword which slays the sins of a man, that he may die to sin,
but rise again to righteousness; the sword of the Spirit, which is the
Word of God, the message of God, the speech of God, the commandment
of God.&nbsp; They were to conquer the world simply by saying, &lsquo;Thus
saith the Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; They were to preach God, and God alone,
revealed in his Son, Jesus Christ, a God of love, who willed that none
should perish, but that all should come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>But a God of wrath likewise.&nbsp; We must never forget that.&nbsp;
A merely indulgent God would be an unjust God, and a cruel God likewise.&nbsp;
If God be just, as he is, then he has boundless pity for those who are
weak: but boundless wrath for the strong who misuse the weak.&nbsp;
Boundless pity for those who are ignorant, misled, and out of the right
way: but boundless wrath for those who mislead them, and put them out
of the right way.&nbsp; All through St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, as through
our blessed Lord&rsquo;s sayings and doings, you see this wholesome
mixture of severity and mercy, of Divine anger and Divine love, very
different from the sentimentalism of our own times, when men fancy that,
because they dislike the pain and trouble of punishing evil-doers, God
is even such a one as themselves, who sits still and takes no heed of
the wrong which is done on earth.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; The Christians were to tell men of both sides of God&rsquo;s
character; for both were working every day, and all day long, about
them.&nbsp; They were to tell men that God had, by their mouths, revealed
from heaven his wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
men, at the same moment that he had revealed the good news that men
might be purified by the blood of Christ, and saved from wrath through
him.&nbsp; They were to tell men of a God who so loved the world that
he gave his only-begotten Son to die for it; but of a God who so loved
the world that he would not tolerate in it those sins which cause the
ruin of the world.&nbsp; Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of
man that doeth evil, and glory, honour, and peace to every man that
worketh good - that was to be their message, that was to be their weapon,
wherewith they were to strike, and did strike, through the hearts of
sinners, and convert them to repentance that they might die to sin,
and live again to righteousness.</p>
<p>With this armour, and that one weapon, the Word of God, the Christians
conquered the souls of the men of the old world.&nbsp; Often they failed,
often they were defeated, sadly and shamefully; for they were men of
like passions with ourselves.&nbsp; But their defeats always happened
when they tried other armour than the armour of God, and fancied that
they could fight the world, the flesh, and the devil with the weapons
which the world, the flesh, and the devil had forged.</p>
<p>Still they conquered at last - for God was with them, and the Spirit
of God; and they put on again and again the armour of God, <i>after</i>
they had cast it off for a while to their own hurt.</p>
<p>And so shall we conquer in the battle of life just in proportion
as we fight our battle with the armour of God.</p>
<p>My friends, each and all of you surely wish to succeed in life; and
to succeed, not merely in getting money, still less merely in getting
pleasure, but with a far nobler and far more real success.&nbsp; You
wish, I trust, to be worthy, virtuous, respectable, useful Christian
men and women; to be honoured while you live, and regretted when you
die; to leave this world with the feeling that your life has not been
a failure, and your years given you in vain: but that, having done some
honest work at least in this world, you are going to a world where all
injustice shall be set right.</p>
<p>Then here, in St. Paul&rsquo;s words, are the elements of success
in life.&nbsp; This, and this only, is the way to true success, to put
on the whole armour of God.&nbsp; Truthfulness, justice, peaceableness,
faith in God&rsquo;s justice and mercy, hope of success, and the sword
of the Spirit, even that word of God which, if you do not preach it
to others, you can and should preach to yourselves all day long, continually
asking yourselves, &lsquo;What would God have me to do?&nbsp; What is
likely to be his will and message upon the matter which I have in hand?&rsquo;
- all these qualities go to make up the character of the worthy man
or woman, the useful person, the truly able person, who does what he
can do, well, because he is what he ought to be, good; and all these
qualities you need if you will fight the battle of life like men, and
conquer instead of being conquered therein.</p>
<p>But some will say, and with truth, &lsquo;It is easy to tell us to
be good: we can no more change our own character than we can change
our own bodies; the question is, who will make us good?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Who indeed, save he who said, &lsquo;Ask and ye shall receive?&rsquo;&nbsp;
St. Paul knew well enough that if his armour was God&rsquo;s armour,
God alone could forge it, and God alone could bestow it; and therefore
he ends his commands with this last command - &lsquo;Praying always,
with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and watching thereto
with all perseverance, and supplication for all saints.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Those who wrote the Church Catechism knew it likewise, and have said
to us from our very childhood: &lsquo;My good child, know this: that
thou canst not do these things of thyself, nor walk in the commandments
of God and serve him without his special grace; which thou must learn
at all times to call for by diligent prayer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes, my friends, there is but one way to obtain that armour of God,
which will bring us safe through the battle of life; and that is, pray
for it.&nbsp; Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and ye shall
find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.&nbsp; You who wish for
true success in life, pray.&nbsp; Pray, if you never prayed before,
morning and evening, with your whole hearts, for that Spirit of God
which is truth, justice, peace, faith, and hope - and you shall not
pray in vain.</p>

<h2>SERMON XII. - PAUL AND FELIX</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>ACTS xxiv. 25.</p>
<p>And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to
come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I
have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</p>
<p>This is a well-known text, on which many a sermon has been preached,
and with good reason, for it is an important text.&nbsp; It tells us
of a man who, like too many men in all times, trembled when he heard
the truth about his wicked life, but did not therefore repent and mend;
and a very serious lesson we may draw from his example.</p>
<p>But even a more important fact about the text is, that it tells us
what were really the fundamental doctrines of the Christian religion
in those early times, about twenty-five years, seemingly, after our
Lord&rsquo;s death; what St. Paul used to preach about; what he considered
was the first thing which he had to tell men.</p>
<p>Let us take this latter question first.&nbsp; About what did St.
Paul reason before Felix?</p>
<p>About righteousness (which means justice), temperance, and judgment
to come.</p>
<p>I beg you to remember these words.&nbsp; If you believe the Bible
to be inspired, you are bound to take its words as they stand.&nbsp;
And therefore I beg you to remember that St. Paul preached not about
<i>un</i>righteousness, but righteousness; not about <i>in</i>temperance,
but about temperance; not about hell, but about judgment to come; in
a word, not about wrong, but about right.&nbsp; I hope that does not
seem to you a small matter.&nbsp; I hope that none of you are ready
to say, &lsquo;It comes to the same thing in the end.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
does not come to the same thing.&nbsp; There is no use in telling a
man what is wrong, unless you first tell him what is right.&nbsp; There
is no use rebuking a man for being bad, unless you first tell him how
he may become better, and give him hope for himself, or you will only
drive him to recklessness and despair.&nbsp; You must show him the right
road, before you can complain of him for going the wrong one.</p>
<p>But if St. Paul had reasoned with Felix about injustice, intemperance,
and hell, one could not have been surprised.&nbsp; For Felix was a thoroughly
bad man, unjust and intemperate, and seemingly fitting himself for hell.</p>
<p>He had begun life as a slave of the emperor in a court which was
a mere sink of profligacy and villainy.&nbsp; Then he had got his freedom,
and next, the governorship of Jud&aelig;a, probably by his brother Pallas&rsquo;s
interest, who had been a slave like him, and had made an enormous fortune
by the most detestable wickedness.</p>
<p>When in his governorship, Felix began to show himself as wicked as
his brother.&nbsp; The violence, misrule, extortion, and cruelty which
went on in Jud&aelig;a was notorious.&nbsp; He caused the high-priest
at Jerusalem to be murdered out of spite.&nbsp; Drusilla, his wife,
he had taken away from a Syrian king, who was her lawful husband.&nbsp;
Making money seems to have been his great object; and the great Roman
historian of those times sums up his character in a few bitter words
thus: &lsquo;Felix,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;exercised the power of a
king with the heart of a slave, in all cruelty and lust.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such was the wicked upstart whom God, for the sins of the Jews, had
allowed to rule them in St. Paul&rsquo;s time; and before him St. Paul
had to plead for his life.</p>
<p>The first time that St. Paul came before him Felix seems to have
seen at once that Paul was innocent, and a good man; and that, perhaps,
was the reason why he sent for him again, and, strangely enough, heard
him concerning the faith in Christ.</p>
<p>There was some conscience left, it seems, in the wretched man.&nbsp;
He was not easy, amid his ill-gotten honour, ill-gotten wealth, ill-gotten
pleasures; and perhaps, as many men are in such a case, he was superstitious,
afraid of being punished for his sins, and looking out for false prophets,
smooth preachers, new religions which would make him comfortable in
his sins, and drug his conscience by promising the wicked man life,
where God had not promised it.&nbsp; So he wanted, it seems, to know
what this new faith in Christ was like; and he heard.</p>
<p>And what he heard we may very fairly guess, because we know from
St. Paul&rsquo;s writings what he was in the habit of saying.</p>
<p>St. Paul told him of righteousness - a word of which he was very
fond.&nbsp; He told Felix of a righteous and good God, who had manifested
to man his righteousness and goodness, in the righteousness and goodness
of his Son Jesus; a righteous God, who wished to make all men righteous
like himself, that they might be happy for ever.&nbsp; Perhaps St. Paul
called Felix to give up all hopes of having his own righteousness -
the false righteousness of forms, and ceremonies, and superstitions
- and to ask for the righteousness of Christ, which is a clean heart
and a right spirit; and then he set before him no doubt, as was his
custom, the beauty of righteousness, the glory of it, as St. Paul calls
it; how noble, honourable, divine, godlike a thing it is to be good.</p>
<p>Then St. Paul told Felix of temperance.&nbsp; And what he said we
may fairly guess from his writings.&nbsp; He would tell Felix that there
were two elements in every man, the flesh and the spirit, and that those
warred against each other: the flesh trying to drag him down, that he
may become a brute in fleshly lusts and passions; the spirit trying
to raise him up, that he may become a son of God in purity and virtue.&nbsp;
But if so, what need must there be of temperance!&nbsp; How must a man
be bound to be temperate, to keep under his body and bring it into subjection,
bound to restrain the lower and more brutal feelings in him, that the
higher and purer feelings may grow and thrive in him to everlasting
life!&nbsp; Truly the temperate man, the man who can restrain himself,
is the only strong man, the only safe man, the only happy man, the only
man worthy of the name of man at all.&nbsp; This, or something like
this, St. Paul would have said to Felix.&nbsp; He did not, as far as
we know, rebuke him for his sins.&nbsp; He left him to rebuke himself.&nbsp;
He told him what ought to be, what he ought to do, and left the rest
to his conscience.&nbsp; Poor Felix, brought up a heathen slave in that
profligate court of Rome, had probably never heard of righteousness
and temperance, had never had what was good and noble set before him.&nbsp;
Now St. Paul set the good before him, and showed him a higher life than
any he had ever dreamed of - higher than all his viceregal power and
pomp - and bade him see how noble and divine it was to be good.</p>
<p>But it is written St. Paul reasoned with Felix about judgment to
come.</p>
<p>We must not too hastily suppose that this means that he told Felix
that he was in danger of hell-fire.&nbsp; For that is an argument which
St. Paul never uses anywhere in his writings or speeches, as far as
we know them.&nbsp; He never tries, as too many do now-a-days, to frighten
sinners into repentance, by telling them of the flames of hell; and
therefore we have no right to fancy that he did so by Felix.&nbsp; He
told him of judgment to come; and we can guess from his writings what
he would have said.&nbsp; That there was a living God who judged the
earth always by his Son Jesus Christ, and that he was coming then, immediately,
to punish all the horrible wickedness which was then going on in those
parts of the world which St. Paul knew.&nbsp; St. Paul always speaks
of the terrible judgments of God as about to come in his own days, we
know that they did come.</p>
<p>We know - God forbid that a preacher should tell you one-tenth of
what he ought to know - that St. Paul&rsquo;s times were the most horribly
wicked that the world had ever seen; that the few heathens who had consciences
left felt that some terrible punishment must come if the world went
on as it was going.&nbsp; And we know that the punishment did come;
and that for about twenty years, towards the end of which St. Paul was
beheaded, the great Roman Empire was verily a hell on earth.&nbsp; If
Felix lived ten years more he saw the judgment of God, and the vengeance
of God, in a way which could not be mistaken.&nbsp; But did judgment
to come overtake him in his life?&nbsp; We do not altogether know; we
know that he committed such atrocities, that the Roman Emperor Nero
was forced to recall him; that the chief Jews of C&aelig;sarea sent
to Rome, and there laid such accusations against him that he was in
danger of death; that his brother Pallas, who was then in boundless
power, saved him from destruction.&nbsp; That shortly afterwards Pallas
himself was disgraced, stripped of his offices, and a few years later
poisoned by Nero, and it is probable enough that when he fell Felix
fell with him: but we know nothing of it certainly.</p>
<p>But at least he saw with his own eyes that there was such a thing
as judgment to come, not merely thousands of years hence at the last
day, but there and then in his own lifetime.&nbsp; He saw the wrath
of God revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness of men.&nbsp;
He saw the wicked murdering and destroying each other till the land
was full of blood.&nbsp; He saw the Empress-mother Agrippina, who had
been the paramour of his brother Pallas, murdered by her own son, the
Emperor Nero; and so judgment came on her.&nbsp; He saw his own brother
first ruined and then poisoned; and so judgment came on him.&nbsp; He
saw many a man whom he knew well, and who had been mixed up with him
and his brother in their intrigues, put to death himself; and so judgment
came on them.</p>
<p>And last of all he saw (unless he had died beforehand) the fall of
the Emperor Nero himself - who very probably set fire to Rome, and then
laid the blame on the Christians, - the man of sin, of whom St. Paul
prophesied that he would be revealed - that is, unveiled, and exposed
for the monster which he was; and that the Lord would destroy him with
the brightness of his coming; the man who had dressed the Christians
in skins, and hunted them with dogs; who had covered them with pitch,
and burnt them; who had beheaded St. Paul and crucified St. Peter; who
had murdered his own wife; who had put to death every good man whom
he could seize, simply for being good; who had committed every conceivable
sin, fault, and cruelty that can disgrace a man, while he made the people
worship him as God.&nbsp; He saw that great Emperor Nero hunted down
by his own people, who were weary of his crimes; condemned to a horrible
death, hiding in a filthy hole, and at last stabbing himself in despair;
and so judgment came on him likewise; while the very heathen felt that
Nero was gone to hell, leaving his name behind him as a proverb of wickedness
and cruelty for ever.</p>
<p>So Felix, if he were alive, saw judgment come.&nbsp; And yet more:
he saw, if he were alive, such a time follow as the world has seldom
or never seen - civil war, bloodshed, lawlessness, plunder, and every
horror; a time in which men longed to die and could not find death,
and, instead of repenting of their evil deeds, gnawed their tongues
for pain, and blasphemed the God of heaven, as St. John had prophesied
in the Revelation.</p>
<p>Yes, if Felix lived only ten years after he trembled at St. Paul&rsquo;s
words, he saw enough to show him that those words were true; that there
was a God in heaven, whose wrath was revealed against all unrighteousness
of men; who was coming out of his place to judge the earth, and punish
all the tyranny and pride and profligacy and luxury of that Roman world.</p>
<p>God grant that he did remember St. Paul&rsquo;s words.&nbsp; God
grant that he trembled once more, and to good purpose; and so repented
of his sins even at the last.&nbsp; God grant that he may find mercy
in that Day.&nbsp; But we can have but little hope for him; it is but
too probable that he was put to death with his brother, within five
years of the time when St. Paul warned him of judgment to come, - too
probable that that was his last chance of salvation, and that he threw
it away for ever, as too many sinners do.</p>
<p>What do we learn then from this sad story?&nbsp; We learn one most
practical and important lesson, which we are all too apt to forget.</p>
<p>That the foundation of the Christian religion is not forms and ceremonies,
nor fancies and feelings, but righteousness, temperance, and judgment
to come.&nbsp; Judgment, I say, to come whensoever it may seem good
to Christ, who sits for ever on his throne judging right, and ministering
true judgment among the people.&nbsp; A dreadful judgment, says the
Commination Service, is always hanging over the heads of those who do
wrong, and always ready to fall on them, without waiting for the last
day, thousands of years hence.&nbsp; It was by telling men that - by
telling them that Christ was righteous and pure, and desired to make
them righteous and pure like himself; and that Christ was a living and
present judge, watching all their actions, ready at any moment to forgive
their sins, and ready at any moment to punish their sins - by that message
the Apostles converted the heathen.&nbsp; It was by believing that message,
and becoming righteous and good men, temperate and pure men, and looking
up in faith and hope to Christ their ever-present Judge and Lord, that
the heathen were converted, and became saints and martyrs.&nbsp; And
that religion will stand, and bring a man through the storm safe to
everlasting life, while all religions which are built on doctrines and
systems, on forms and ceremonies, on fancies and feelings, on the godless
notion that sinners are safe enough in this life, for God will not judge
and punish them till the last day, are built on a foundation of sand;
and the storm when it comes will sweep those dreams away, and leave
their possessors to shame and misery.</p>
<p>Therefore, my friends, let no man deceive you.&nbsp; God is not mocked.&nbsp;
What a man soweth, that shall he reap.&nbsp; The wages of sin are death,
as Felix found too well; but the fruit of righteousness is everlasting
life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.&nbsp; Therefore follow after innocency,
and take heed to the thing which is right; for that, and that only,
shall bring a man peace at the last.</p>

<h2>SERMON XIII. - THE GOOD SAMARITAN</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>LUKE x. 33, 34.</p>
<p>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and
when he saw him, he had compassion on him, and went to him, and bound
up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast,
and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</p>
<p>No words, perhaps, ever spoken on earth, have had more effect than
those of this parable.&nbsp; They are words of power and of spirit;
living words, which have gone forth into the hearts and lives of men,
and borne fruit in them of a hundred different kinds.&nbsp; Truly their
sound is gone out into all lands, and their words to the ends of the
world, for a proof that Christ, who spake them, said truly, when he
said, &lsquo;The flesh profiteth nothing; it is the spirit which maketh
alive.&nbsp; The words which I speak unto you, they are spirit and they
are life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What was the power and the spirit of this parable?&nbsp; What gave
it its strength in the hearts of men?&nbsp; This - that it told them
that they were to help their fellow-men, simply because they were their
fellow-men.&nbsp; Not because they were of the same race, the same religion,
the same sect or party; but simply because they were men.&nbsp; In a
word, it commanded men to be humane; to exercise humanity; which signifies,
kindness to human beings, simply because they are human beings.&nbsp;
One can understand our Lord preaching that: it was part and parcel of
his doctrine.&nbsp; He called himself the Son of Man.&nbsp; He showed
what he meant by calling himself so, by the widest and most tender humanity.</p>
<p>But his was quite a new doctrine, and a new practice likewise.&nbsp;
The Jews had no notion of humanity.&nbsp; All but themselves were common
and unclean.&nbsp; They might not even eat with a man who was a Gentile.&nbsp;
All mankind, save themselves, they thought, were accursed and doomed
to hell.&nbsp; They lived, as St. Paul told them, hateful to, and hated
by, all mankind.&nbsp; There was no humanity in them.</p>
<p>The Greek, again, despised all nations but his own as barbarians.&nbsp;
He would mix with them, eat with them, work for them; but he only looked
on the rest of mankind as stupid savages, out of whom he was to make
money, by the basest and meanest arts.&nbsp; There was no humanity in
him.</p>
<p>The Romans, again, were a thoroughly inhuman people.&nbsp; Their
calling, they held, was to conquer all the nations of the earth, to
plunder them, to enslave them.&nbsp; They were the great slaveholding,
man-stealing people.&nbsp; Mercy was a virtue which they had utterly
forgotten.&nbsp; Their public shows and games were mere butcheries of
blood and torture.&nbsp; To see them fight to death in their theatres,
pairs after pairs, sometimes thousands in one day, was the usual and
regular amusement.&nbsp; And in that great city of Rome, which held
something more than a million human beings, there was not, as far as
I am aware, one single hospital, or other charitable institution of
any kind.&nbsp; There was, in a word, no humanity in them.</p>
<p>But the Gospel changed all that miraculously and suddenly, both in
Jew, in Greek, and in Roman.&nbsp; When men became Christians at St.
Paul&rsquo;s preaching, all the old barriers of race were broken down
between them.&nbsp; They said no more, &lsquo;I am a Roman,&rsquo; &lsquo;I
a Greek,&rsquo; &lsquo;I a Jew,&rsquo; but &lsquo;I am a Christian man;
and, because I am a Christian, Roman and Greek and Jew are alike my
brothers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was seen such a sight as (so far as we know) was never seen
before on earth - the high-born white lady worshipping by the side of
her own negro slave; the proud and selfish Roman, who never had helped
a human being in his life, sending his alms to the churches of Syria,
or of some other country far away; the clever and educated Greek learning
from the Jew, whom he called a barbarian; and the Jew, who had hated
all mankind, and been hated by them in return, preaching to all mankind
the good news that they were brothers, in the name and for the sake
of Jesus Christ, the Son of Man.</p>
<p>Instead of a kingdom of division, the Church was a kingdom of union.&nbsp;
Charity, and generosity, and mutual help took the place of selfishness,
and distrust, and oppression.&nbsp; While men had been heathens, their
pattern had been that of the priest who saw the wounded man lying, and
looked on him and passed by.&nbsp; Their pattern now was that of the
good Samaritan, who helped and saved the wounded stranger, simply because
he was a man.</p>
<p>In one word, the new thing which the Gospel brought into the world
was - humanity.&nbsp; The thing which the Gospel keeps in the world
still, is humanity.&nbsp; It brought other things, and blessed things,
but this it brought.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Because through the Church
was poured on men the spirit of God.&nbsp; And what is that, save humanity?
- the spirit of the compassionate, all generous Son of Man? - the spirit
of charity and love?</p>
<p>What were the woes of humanity to the heathen?&nbsp; If a man fell
in the race of life, so much the worse for him.&nbsp; So much the better
for them, for there was one more competitor out of the way.&nbsp; One
of the greatest Roman poets, indeed, talks of the pleasure which men
have in seeing others in trouble, just as, when the storm is tossing
up the sea, it is sweet to sit on the shore, and watch the ships labouring
in the waves.&nbsp; Not, he says, that one takes actual pleasure in
seeing a man in trouble, but in the thought that one is not in the trouble
oneself.&nbsp; A rather lame excuse, I think, for a rather inhuman sentiment.</p>
<p>Yes, the heathen could feel pleasure in being safe while others were
afflicted.&nbsp; And, indeed, our own fallen nature, if we give way
to it, will tempt us to the same sin.&nbsp; But how did men begin to
look not only on the afflictions, but on the interest, on the feelings,
on the consciences of their neighbours, when they began to be led by
the spirit of Christ?&nbsp; Let St. Paul speak for himself, not in one
text only, but in a hundred - &lsquo;Though I be free from all, I have
made myself a servant to all - a Jew to the Jews, a Greek to the Greeks,
strong to the strong, weak to the weak; all things to all men, if by
any means I might save some.&nbsp; Whether we be afflicted, it is for
your consolation and salvation; or whether we be comforted, it is for
your consolation and salvation.&nbsp; For the love of Christ constraineth
us.&nbsp; For he died for all, that those who live should henceforth
not live to themselves, but to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And what did he mean by living to Christ? - &lsquo;Living in weariness
and painfulness, in watchings often; in hunger and thirst, in fastings
often, in cold and nakedness; beside that which cometh upon me daily,
the care of all the Church.&nbsp; Who is weak, and I am not weak?&nbsp;
Who is offended, and I burn not?&rsquo; - Oh, who does not see in such
words as these the picture of a new ideal, a new life for man; even
a life of utter sympathy with his fellow-men, utter love and self-sacrifice
- in one word, utter humanity; as far above that old heathen poet&rsquo;s
selfish notion, as man is above the ape, or heaven above the earth!</p>
<p>This is the spirit of God, even the Holy Ghost; the spirit of Christ,
which also is the spirit of humanity; because it is the spirit of Christ,
who is both God and man, both human and divine.&nbsp; This is the spirit
of love, by which God created mankind and all the worlds, that he might
have something which was not himself whereon to spend his boundless
love.&nbsp; This is the spirit of love, by which he spared not his only-begotten
Son, but freely gave him for the sins of all mankind.&nbsp; This is
the spirit of love, by which he is leading mankind through strange paths,
and by ways which their fathers knew not, toward that eternal city of
God which all truly human hearts are seeking, blindly often and confusedly,
and sometimes by utterly mistaken paths: but seeking her still, if by
any means they may enter into her, and be at peace.&nbsp; This is that
spirit of love, by which, having sent forth all souls out of his everlasting
bosom, he will draw them home again in the fulness of time, as many
as have eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord, into his bosom once more,
that they may rest in peace, and God be all in all.</p>
<p>Take comfort from these words, my friends; for there is deep comfort
to be found in them, if you will look at them aright.&nbsp; When you
hear that the spirit of God is in you, unless you are reprobates; and
that if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his - do
not be afraid, as if that spirit were something quite unlike anything
which you feel, or even think of: as if it was something which must
show itself in strange visions or peculiar experiences, which very few
persons have, and which tempt them to set themselves apart from their
fellow-men, and thank God that they are not as other men are.&nbsp;
Remember that the spirit of God is the spirit of Christ, and that the
spirit of Christ is the spirit by which the good Samaritan helped the
poor wounded man, simply because he was a man.&nbsp; Remember that the
spirit of God, so far from making you unlike a man, comes to make you
more perfect men; so far from parting you from your fellow-men, comes
to knit you more to your fellow-men, by making you understand them,
feel for them, make allowances for them, long to help them, however
different in habits or in opinions they may be from you; that it is,
in one word, the spirit of humanity, which comes down from heaven into
your hearts to make you humane, as it descended on Christ, that he might
be the most humane of all human beings - the very Son of Man, who knew,
understood, loved, suffered for, and redeemed all mankind, because in
him all humanity was gathered into one.</p>
<p>That spirit is not far from any of you.&nbsp; Surely he is in all
your hearts already, if you be worthy of the name of men.&nbsp; He is
in you, unless you be inhuman, and that, I trust, none of you are.&nbsp;
From him come every humane thought and feeling you ever had.&nbsp; All
kindliness, pity, mercy, generosity; all sense or justice and honour
toward your fellow-men; all indignation when you hear of their being
wronged, tortured, enslaved; all desire to help the fallen, to right
the oppressed; - whence do these come?&nbsp; From the world?&nbsp; Most
surely not.&nbsp; From the flesh?&nbsp; St. Paul says not.&nbsp; From
the Devil?&nbsp; No one, I trust, will say that, save his own children,
the Pharisees, if there be any of them left, which we will hope there
are not.&nbsp; No! all these come from the gracious spirit of humanity
- the spirit of Christ and of God.&nbsp; Pray to him, that he may take
possession of all your thoughts, feelings, and desires, and purge you
from every taint of selfishness.&nbsp; Give up your hearts to him; and
grieve not, by any selfishness, passion, or hardness of your own, his
gracious instructions: but let him teach you, and guide you, and purge
you, and sanctify you, till you come to the stature of a perfect man,
to the fulness of the measure of Christ, who could perfectly hate the
sin, and yet perfectly love the sinner; who could see in every man,
even in his enemies and murderers, a friend and a brother.</p>
<p>And you who are afflicted, remember, that if the spirit of humanity
be the spirit of Christ, the spirit of Christ is also the spirit of
humanity.&nbsp; What do I mean?&nbsp; This: that if that good Samaritan
had Christ&rsquo;s spirit, was like Christ, then Christ has the same
spirit, and is like that good Samaritan, utterly humane, for mere humanity&rsquo;s
sake.</p>
<p>Yes, thou who art weary and heavy laden - thou who fanciest, at moments,
that the Lord&rsquo;s arm is shortened, that it cannot save, and art
ready to cry, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? - take comfort,
and look upon Christ.&nbsp; Thou wilt never be sure of the love of God,
unless thou rememberest that it is the same as the love of Christ; and,
by looking at Christ, learnest to know thy Father and his Father, whose
likeness and image he is, and see that the spirit which proceeds alike
from both of them is the spirit of humanity and love, which cannot help
going forth to seek and to save thee, simply because thou art lost.&nbsp;
Look, I say, at Christ; and be sure that what he bade the good Samaritan
do to the wounded traveller, that same will he do to thee, because he
is the Son of Man, human and humane.</p>
<p>Art thou robbed, wounded, deserted, left to die, worsted in the battle
of life, and fallen in its rugged road, with no counsel, no strength,
no hope, no purpose left?&nbsp; Then remember, that there is one walking
to and fro in this world, unseen, but ever present, whose form is as
the form of the Son of Man.</p>
<p>To him is given all power to execute judgment in heaven and earth,
because he is the Son of Man.&nbsp; He is beholding the nations and
fashioning all their hearts.&nbsp; Even as I speak now, he is pouring
contempt on princes, and making the counsels of the people of no effect.&nbsp;
Even now he is frustrating the tokens of the liars, and making diviners
mad.&nbsp; He is smiting asunder mighty nations, and filling the lands
with dead bodies.&nbsp; Even now he is coming, as he came of old from
Bozra, treading down the people in his anger, and making them dumb in
his fury; and their blood is sprinkled on his garments, and he hath
stained all his raiment.&nbsp; For the day of vengeance is in his heart,
and the year of his redeemed is come.&nbsp; He who ariseth terribly
to shake the nations, has he time, has he will, to turn aside to attend
to such as thee?</p>
<p>He has time, and he has will.&nbsp; No human being so mean, no human
sorrow too petty, but what he has the time and the will, as well as
the power, to have mercy on it, because he is the Son of Man.&nbsp;
Therefore he will turn aside even to thee, whoever thou art, who art
weary and heavy laden, and canst find no rest for thy soul, at the very
moment, and in the very manner, which is best for thee.&nbsp; When thou
hast suffered long enough, he will stablish, strengthen, settle thee.&nbsp;
He will bind up thy wounds, and pour in the oil and the wine of his
spirit - the Holy Ghost, the Comforter; and will carry thee to his own
inn, whereof it is written, He shall hide thee secretly in his own presence
from the provoking of men; he shall keep thee in his tabernacle from
the strife of tongues.&nbsp; He will give his servants charge over thee
to keep thee in all thy ways; and when he comes again, he will repay
them, and fetch thee away, to give thee rest in that eternal bosom of
the Father, from which thou, like all human souls, camest forth at first,
and to which thou shalt at last return, with all human souls who have
in them that spirit of humanity, which is the spirit of God, and of
Christ, and of eternal life.</p>

<h2>SERMON XIV. - CONSIDER THE LILIES OF THE FIELD</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(<i>Preached on Easter Day</i>, 1867.)</p>
<p>MATTHEW vi. 26, 28, 29.</p>
<p>Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap,
nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.&nbsp;
Are ye not much better than they? . . . And why take ye thought for
raiment?&nbsp; Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they
toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon
in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</p>
<p>What has this text to do with Easter-day?&nbsp; Let us think a while.&nbsp;
Life and death; the battle between life and death; life conquered by
death; and death conquered again by life.&nbsp; Those were the mysteries
over which the men of old time thought, often till their hearts were
sad.</p>
<p>They saw that they were alive; and they loved life, and would fain
see good days.&nbsp; They saw, again, that they must die: but would
death conquer life in them?&nbsp; Would they ever live again?</p>
<p>They saw that other things died, or seemed to die, and yet rose and
lived again; and that gave them hope for themselves at times; but their
hopes were very dim, till Christ came, and brought life and immortality
to light.</p>
<p>They saw, I say, that other things died, or seemed to die, and yet
lived again.&nbsp; Light rose out of darkness every morning and lived:
but darkness, as they thought, killed the light at even, till it came
to life again in the morning, and the sun rose once more.&nbsp; The
sun himself - they thought of him as a glorious and life-giving being,
who every morning fought his way up the sky, scattering the dark clouds
with his golden arrows, and reigning for a-while in heaven, pouring
down heat and growth and life: but he too must die.&nbsp; The dark clouds
of evening must cover him.&nbsp; The red glare upon them was his dying
blood.&nbsp; The twilight, which lingered after the sun was gone, was
his bride, the dawn, come to soothe his dying hour.&nbsp; True, he had
come to life again, often and often, morning after morning: but would
it be so for ever?&nbsp; Would not a night come at last, after which
he would never rise again?&nbsp; Would not he be worn out at last, and
slain, in his long daily battle with the kingdom of darkness, which
lay below the world; or with the dragon who tried to devour him, when
the thunder clouds hid him from the sight, or the eclipse seemed to
swallow him up before their eyes?</p>
<p>So, too, they felt about the seasons of the year.&nbsp; The winter
came.&nbsp; The sun grew low and weak.&nbsp; Would he not die?&nbsp;
The days grew short and dark.&nbsp; Would they not cease to be, and
eternal night come on the earth?&nbsp; They had heard dimly of the dark
northern land, where it was always winter, and the night was six months
long.&nbsp; Why should it not be so in their own land in some evil time?&nbsp;
Every autumn the rains and frost came on; the leaves fell; the flowers
withered; the birds fled southward, or died of hunger and cold; the
cattle starved in the field; the very men had much ado to live.&nbsp;
Why should not winter conquer at last, and shut up the sun, the God
of light and warmth and life, for ever in the place of darkness, cold,
and death?&nbsp; So thought the old Syrians of Canaan, and taught the
Jewish women to weep, as they themselves wept every autumn, over Adonai,
the Lord, which was another name for the sun, slain, as they thought,
by the winter cold and rain: and then, when spring-time came, with its
sunshine, flowers, and birds, rejoiced that the sun had come to life
again.</p>
<p>So thought the old Greeks, and told how Persephone, the fair maiden
who was the spring-time, was stolen away by the king of darkness who
lived beneath the earth; and how her mother earth would not be comforted
for her loss, but sent barrenness on all the world till her daughter,
the spring, was given back to her, to dwell for six months in the upper
world of light, and six months in the darkness under ground.</p>
<p>So thought our old forefathers; and told how Baldur (the Baal of
the Bible), the god of light and heat, who was likewise the sun, was
slain by treachery, and imprisoned for ever below in hell, the kingdom
of darkness and of cold; and how all things on earth, even the very
trees and stones, wept for his death: yet all their tears could not
bring back from death the god of life: nor any of the gods unlock the
gates which held him in.</p>
<p>And because our forefathers were a sad and earnest folk: because
they lived in a sad and dreary climate, where winter was far longer
and more bitter than it is, thank God, now; therefore all their thoughts
about winter and spring were sad; and they grew to despair, at last,
of life ever conquering death, or light conquering darkness.&nbsp; An
age would come, they said, in which snow should fall from the four corners
of the world, and the winters be three winters long; an evil age, of
murder and adultery, and hatred between brethren, when all the ties
of kin would be rent asunder, and wickedness should triumph on the earth.</p>
<p>Then should come that dark time which they called the twilight of
the gods.&nbsp; Then the powers of evil would be let loose; the earth
would go to ruin in darkness and in flame.&nbsp; All living things would
die.&nbsp; The very gods would die, fighting to the last against the
powers of evil, till the sun should sink for ever, and the world be
a heap of ashes.</p>
<p>And then - so strangely does God&rsquo;s gift of hope linger in the
hearts of men - they saw, beyond all that, a dim dream of a new heaven
and a new earth in which should dwell righteousness; and of a new sun,
more beautiful than ours; of a woman called &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; hid
safe while all the world around her was destroyed, fed on the morning
dew, preserved to be the mother of a new and happier race of men.&nbsp;
And so to them, heathens as they were, God whispered that Christ should
some day bring life and immortality to light.</p>
<p>My friends, shall we sneer and laugh at all these dreams, as mere
follies of the heathen?&nbsp; If we do so, we shall not show the spirit
of God, or the mind of Christ.&nbsp; Nor shall we show our knowledge
of the Bible.&nbsp; In it, the spirit of God, who inspired the Bible,
does not laugh at these dreams.&nbsp; It rebukes them sternly whenever
they are immoral, and lead men to do bad and foul deeds, as Ezekiel
rebuked the Jewish women who wept for Thammuz, the dead summer.&nbsp;
But that was because those Jewish women should have known better.&nbsp;
They should have known - what the Old Testament tells us all through
- what it was especially meant to tell the men who lived while it was
being written, just because they had their fancies, and their fears
about summer and winter, and life and death.&nbsp; And what ought they
to have known?&nbsp; What does the Old Testament say?&nbsp; That life
will conquer death, because God, the Lord Jehovah, even Jesus Christ,
is Lord of heaven and earth.&nbsp; From the time that it was written
in the Book of Genesis, that the Lord Jehovah said in his heart, &lsquo;I
will not again curse the ground for man&rsquo;s sake: neither will I
again smite any more anything living, as I have done, while the earth
remaineth - seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and
winter, and day and night, shall not cease&rsquo; - from that time the
Jews were bound not to fear the powers of nature, or the seasons, nor
to fear for them; for they were all in the government of that one good
God and Lord, who cared for men, and loved them, and dealt justly by
them, and proved his love and justice by bringing the children of Israel
out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>God treated these heathens, St. Paul says, as we ought to treat our
children.&nbsp; His wrath was revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
and unrighteousness of men.&nbsp; All wilful disobedience and actual
sin he punished, often with terrible severity; but not their childish
mistakes and dreams about how this world was made; just as we should
not punish the fancies of our children.&nbsp; The times of that ignorance,
says St. Paul, he winked at till Christ came, and then he commanded
all men everywhere to repent, and believe in the God who gave them rain
and fruitful seasons, filling their hearts with food and gladness.</p>
<p>For he had appointed a day in which he would judge the world in righteousness
by that man whom he had ordained; of which he had given full assurance
to all men, in that he had raised him from the dead.</p>
<p>Some, who were spoilt by false philosophy, mocked when they heard
of the resurrection of the dead: but there were those who had kept something
of the simple childlike faith of their forefathers, and who were prepared
for the kingdom of God; and to them St. Paul&rsquo;s message came as
an answer to the questions of their minds, and a satisfaction to the
longings of their hearts.</p>
<p>The news of Christ, - of Christ raised from the dead to be the life
and the light of the world, - stilled all their fears lest death should
conquer life, and darkness conquer light.</p>
<p>So it was with all the heathen.&nbsp; So it was with our old forefathers,
when they heard and believed the Gospel of Christ.&nbsp; They felt that
(as St. Paul said) they were translated out of the kingdom of darkness
into the kingdom of light, which was the kingdom of his dear Son; that
now the world must look hopeful, cheerful to them; now they could live
in hope of everlasting life; now they need sorrow no more for those
who slept, as if they had no hope: for Christ had conquered death, and
the evil spirit who had the power of death.&nbsp; Christ had harrowed
hell, and burst the bonds of the graves.&nbsp; He, as man, and yet God,
had been through the dark gate, and had returned through it in triumph,
the first-born from the dead; and his resurrection was an everlasting
sign and pledge that all who belonged to him should rise with him, and
death be swallowed up in victory.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it pleased the Father,&rsquo; says St. Paul, &lsquo;to
gather together in Christ all things, whether in heaven or in earth.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In him were fulfilled, and more than fulfilled, the dim longings, the
childlike dreams of heathen poets and sages, and of our own ancestors
from whom we sprung.&nbsp; He is the desire of all nations; for whom
all were longing, though they knew it not.&nbsp; He is the true sun;
the sun of righteousness, who has arisen with healing on his wings,
and translated us from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light.&nbsp;
He is the true Adonai, the Lord for whose death though we may mourn
upon Good Friday, yet we rejoice this day for his resurrection.&nbsp;
He is the true Baldur, the God of light and life, who, though he died
by treachery, and descended into hell, yet needed not, to deliver him,
the tears of all creation, of men or angels, or that any god should
unlock for him the gates of death; for he rose by his own eternal spirit
of light, and saith, &lsquo;I am he that was dead, and behold I am alive
for evermore.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp; And I have the keys of death and hell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now we may see, it seems to me, what the text has to do with
Easter-day.&nbsp; To my mind our Lord is using here the same parable
which St. Paul preaches in his famous chapter which we read in the Burial
Service.&nbsp; Be not anxious, says our Lord, for your life.&nbsp; Is
not the life more than meat?&nbsp; There is an eternal life which depends
not on earthly food, but on the will and word of God your Father; and
that life in you will conquer death.&nbsp; Behold the birds of the air,
which sow not, nor reap, nor gather into barns, to provide against the
winter&rsquo;s need.&nbsp; But do they starve and die?&nbsp; Does not
God guide them far away into foreign climes, and feed them there by
his providence, and bring them back again in spring, as things alive
from the dead?&nbsp; And can he not feed us (if it be his will) with
a bread which comes down from heaven, and with every word which proceedeth
out of the mouth of God?</p>
<p>Consider, again, the lilies of the field.&nbsp; We must take our
Lord&rsquo;s words exactly.&nbsp; He is speaking of the lilies, the
bulbous plants which spring into flower in countless thousands every
spring, over the downs of Eastern lands.&nbsp; All the winter they are
dead, unsightly roots, hidden in the earth.&nbsp; What can come of them?&nbsp;
But no sooner does the sun of spring shine on their graves, than they
rise into sudden life and beauty, as it pleases God, and every seed
takes its own peculiar body.&nbsp; Sown in corruption, they are raised
in incorruption; sown in weakness, they are raised in power; sown in
dishonour, they are raised in glory; delicate, beautiful in colour,
perfuming the air with fragrance; types of immortality, fit for the
crowns of angels.&nbsp; Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow.&nbsp;
For even so is the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p>Yes, not without a divine providence - yea, a divine inspiration
- has this blessed Easter-tide been fixed, by the Church of all ages,
at the season when the earth shakes off her winter&rsquo;s sleep; when
the birds come back and the flowers begin to bloom; when every seed
which falls into the ground, and dies, and rises again with a new body,
is a witness to us of the resurrection of Christ; and a witness, too,
that we shall rise again; that in us, as in it, life shall conquer death
when every bird which comes back to sing and build among us, is a witness
to us of the resurrection of Christ, and of our resurrection; and that
in us, as in it, joy shall conquer sorrow.</p>
<p>The seed has passed through strange chances and dangers: of a thousand
seeds shed in autumn, scarce one survives to grow in spring.&nbsp; Be
it so.&nbsp; Still there is left, as Scripture says, a remnant, an elect,
to rise again and live.</p>
<p>The birds likewise - they have been through strange chances, dangers,
needs.&nbsp; Far away south to Africa they went - the younger ones by
a way they had never travelled before.&nbsp; Thousands died in their
passage south.&nbsp; Thousands more died in their passage back again
this spring, by hunger and by storm.&nbsp; Be it so.&nbsp; Yet of them
is left a seed, a remnant, an elect, and they are saved, to build once
more in their old homes, and to rejoice in the spring, and pour out
their songs to God who made them.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Some say that the seeds grow by laws of nature; the birds come back
by instinct.&nbsp; Be it so.&nbsp; What Scripture says, and what we
should believe, is this: that the seeds grow by the spirit of God, the
Lord and Giver of life; that the birds come back, and sing, and build
by the spirit of God, the Lord and Giver of life.&nbsp; He works not
on them, things without reason, as he works on us reasonable souls:
but he works on them nevertheless.&nbsp; They obey his call; they do
his will; they show forth his glory; they return to life, they breed,
they are preserved, by the same spirit by which the body of Jesus rose
from the dead; and, therefore, every flower which blossoms, and every
bird which sings, at Easter-tide; everything which, like the seeds,
was dead, and is alive again, which, like the birds, was lost, and is
found, is a type and token of Christ, their Maker, who was dead and
is alive again; who was lost in hell on Easter-eve, and was found again
in heaven for evermore; and the resurrection of the earth from her winter&rsquo;s
sleep commemorates to us, as each blessed Easter-tide comes round, the
resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, who made all the world, and redeemed
all mankind, and sanctifieth to eternal life all the elect people of
God: a witness to us that some day life shall conquer death, light conquer
darkness, righteousness conquer sin, joy conquer grief; when the whole
creation, which groaneth and travaileth in pain until now, shall have
brought forth that of which it travails in labour; even the new heavens
and the new earth, wherein shall be neither sighing nor sorrow, but
God shall wipe away tears from all eyes.</p>

<h2>SERMON XV. - THE JEWISH REBELLIONS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>1 PETER ii. 11.</p>
<p>Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain
from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.</p>
<p>I think that you will understand the text, and indeed the whole of
St. Peter&rsquo;s first Epistle, better, if I explain to you somewhat
the state of the Eastern countries of the world in St. Peter&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; The Romans, a short time before St. Peter was born, had
conquered all the nations round them, and brought them under law and
regular government.&nbsp; St. Peter now tells those to whom he wrote,
that they must obey the Roman governors and their laws, for the Lord&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; It was God&rsquo;s will and providence that the Romans should
be masters of the world at that time.&nbsp; Jesus Christ the Lord, the
King of kings, had so ordained it in his inscrutable wisdom; and they
must submit to it, not for fear of the Romans, but for the Lord&rsquo;s
sake as the servants of God, who believed that he was governing the
world by his Son Jesus Christ, and that he knew best how to govern it.</p>
<p>That was a hard lesson for them to learn; for they were Jews.&nbsp;
This epistle, as the words of it show plainly, was written for Jews;
both for those who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ as the true King
of the Jews, and for those who ought to have believed in him, but did
not.&nbsp; They were strangers and pilgrims (as St. Peter calls them),
who had no city or government of their own, but had been scattered abroad
among the Gentiles, and settled in all the great cities of the Roman
Empire, especially in the East: in Babylon, from which St. Peter wrote
his epistle, where the Jews had a great settlement in the rich plains
of the river Euphrates; in Syria; in Asia Minor, which we now call Turkey
in Asia: in Persia, and many other Eastern lands.&nbsp; There they lived
by trade, very much as the Jews live among us now; and as long as they
obeyed the Roman law, they were allowed to keep their own worship, and
their own customs, and their law of Moses, and to have their synagogues
in which they worshipped the true God every Sabbath-day.&nbsp; But evil
times were coming on these prosperous Jews.&nbsp; Wicked emperors of
Rome and profligate governors of provinces were about to persecute them.&nbsp;
In Alexandria in Egypt, hundreds of them had been destroyed by lingering
tortures, and thousands ruined and left homeless.&nbsp; Caligula, the
mad emperor, had gone further still.&nbsp; Fancying himself a god, he
had commanded that temples should be raised in his honour, and his statues
worshipped everywhere.&nbsp; He had even gone so far as to command that
his statue should be set up in the Temple of Jerusalem, and to do actually
that which St. Paul prophesied a few years after the man of sin would
do, &lsquo;Exalt himself over all that is called God, or that is worshipped;
so that he would sit in the temple of God, and show himself as God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then followed a strange scene, which will help to explain much of
this Epistle of St. Peter.&nbsp; The Jews of Jerusalem did not rise
in rebellion.&nbsp; They did what St. Peter told the Jews of Asia Minor
to do.&nbsp; They determined to suffer for well-doing, - to die as martyrs,
not as rebels.&nbsp; Petronius, the Roman governor who was sent to carry
out the order, was a strange mixture of good and bad.&nbsp; He was a
peculiarly profligate and luxurious man.&nbsp; He wrote one of the foulest
books which ever disgraced the pen of man.&nbsp; But he was kind-hearted,
humane, rational.&nbsp; He had orders to set up the Emperor&rsquo;s
statue in the temple at Jerusalem; and no doubt he laughed inwardly
at the folly: but he must obey orders.&nbsp; Yet he hesitated, when
he landed and saw the Jews come to him in thousands, covering the country
like a cloud, young and old, rich and poor, unarmed, many clothed in
sackcloth and with ashes on their heads, and beseeching him that he
would not commit this abomination.&nbsp; He rebuked them sternly.&nbsp;
He had a whole army at his back, and would compel them to obey.&nbsp;
They answered that they must obey God rather than man.&nbsp; Petronius&rsquo;s
heart relented; he left his soldiers behind and went on to try the Jews
at Tiberias.&nbsp; There he met a similar band.&nbsp; He tried again
to be stern with them.&nbsp; All other nations had worshipped the Emperor&rsquo;s
image, why should not they?&nbsp; Would they make war against their
emperor?&nbsp; &lsquo;We have no thought of war,&rsquo; they cried with
one voice, &lsquo;but we will submit to be massacred rather than break
our law;&rsquo; and at once the whole crowd fell with their faces to
the earth, and declared that they were ready to offer their throats
to the swords of the Roman soldiers.</p>
<p>For forty days that scene lasted; it was the time for sowing, and
the whole land lay untilled.&nbsp; Petronius could do nothing with people
who were ready to be martyrs, but not rebels; and he gave way.&nbsp;
He excused himself to the mad emperor as he best could.&nbsp; He promised
the Jews that he would do all he could for them, even at the risk of
his own life - and he very nearly lost his life in trying to save them.&nbsp;
But the thing tided over, and the poor Jews conquered, as the Christian
martyrs conquered afterwards, by resignation; by that highest courage
which shows itself not in anger but in patience, and suffering instead
of rebelling.</p>
<p>Well it had been for the Jews elsewhere if they had been of the same
mind.&nbsp; But near Babylon, just about the time St. Peter wrote his
epistle, the Jews broke out in open rebellion.&nbsp; Two Jewish orphans,
who had been bred as weavers and ran away from a cruel master, escaped
into the marshes, and there became the leaders of a great band of robbers.&nbsp;
They defeated the governor of Babylon in battle; they went to the court
of the heathen king of Persia, and became great men there.&nbsp; One
of them had the other poisoned, and then committed great crimes, wasted
the country of Babylon with fire and sword, and came to a miserable
end, being slaughtered in bed when in a drunken sleep.&nbsp; Then the
Babylonians rose on all the Jews and massacred them: the survivors fled
to the great city of Seleucia, and mixed themselves up in party riots
with the heathens; the heathens turned on them and slew 50,000 of them;
and so, as St. Peter told them, judgment began at the house of God.</p>
<p>Whether this massacre of the Babylonian Jews happened just before
or just after St. Peter wrote his epistle from Babylon, we cannot tell.&nbsp;
But it is plain, I think, that either this matter or what led to it
was in his mind.&nbsp; It seems most likely that it had happened a little
before, and that he wrote to the Jews in the north-east of Asia Minor,
to warn them against giving way to the same lawless passions which had
brought ruin and misery on the Jews of Babylon.</p>
<p>For they were in great danger of falling into the same misery and
ruin.&nbsp; The Romans expected the Jews to rebel all over the world.&nbsp;
And, as it fell out, they did rebel, and perished in vast numbers miserably,
because they would not take St. Peter&rsquo;s advice; because they would
not obey every ordinance of man for the Lord&rsquo;s sake; because they
would not honour all men: but looked on all men as the enemies of God.</p>
<p>Good for them it would have been, had they taken St. Peter&rsquo;s
advice, which was the only plan, he said, to save their souls and lives
in those terrible times.&nbsp; Good for them if they had believed St.
Peter&rsquo;s gospel, when he told them that God had chosen them to
obedience, and purification by the blood of Christ, to an inheritance
undefiled and that faded not away.</p>
<p>He said that, remember, to all the Jews, whether Christians or not.&nbsp;
St. Peter took for granted that Christ was Lord and King of all the
Jews, whether they believed it or not.&nbsp; He did not say, &lsquo;If
you believe in Christ, then he is your King; if not, then he is not;&rsquo;
but - Because you are Jews, you are all Christ&rsquo;s subjects; to
him you owe faith, loyalty, and obedience.&nbsp; It was of him the old
Jewish prophets foretold, and saw that their prophecies of Christ&rsquo;s
coming would be fulfilled, not in their own time, but in your time -
in the time of the Jews to whom he spoke.&nbsp; Therefore they were
to give up the foolish practices which had been handed down to them
from their forefathers.&nbsp; Therefore they were to give up fleshly
lusts, which warred against the soul, and would only bring them to destruction;
therefore they were to be holy, even as God was holy; therefore they
were to purify their souls in sincere brotherly love; therefore they
were to keep their conduct honourable among the Gentiles, that, though
they were now spoken against as evil-doers, they might see their good
works, and glorify God in the coming day of visitation.&nbsp; Therefore
they were to submit to every ordinance of man for the Lord&rsquo;s sake;
and trust to Christ, their true King in heaven, to deliver them from
oppression, and free them from injustice, in his own good way and time.&nbsp;
Free men they were in the sight of God, and unjustly enslaved by the
Romans: but they were not to make their being free men a cloak and excuse
for malice and evil passions against the Gentiles (as too many of the
Jews were doing), but remember that they were the servants of God; and
serve him, and trust in him to deliver them in his own way and time,
by his Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Those Jews who believed St. Peter&rsquo;s gospel and good news that
Christ was their King and Saviour, kept their souls in peace.</p>
<p>Those Jews who did not believe St. Peter - and they, unhappily for
them, were the far greater number - broke out into mad rebellion again,
and perished in vast numbers, till they were destroyed off the face
of the earth (as St. Peter had warned them) by their own fleshly lusts,
which warred against the soul.</p>
<p>But what has this to do with us?</p>
<p>It has everything to do with us, if we believe that we are Christian
men; that Christ is our King, and the King of all the world, just as
much as he was King of the Jews; that all power is given to him in heaven
and earth, and that he is actually exercising his power, and governing
all heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; If we really believed in the kingdom of God and Christ;
if we really believed that the fate of nations is determined, not by
kings, not by conquerors, not by statesmen, not by parliaments, not
by the people, but by God; that we, England, the world, are going God&rsquo;s
way, and not our own; then we should look hopefully, peacefully, contentedly,
on the matters which are too apt now to fret us; for we should say more
often than we do, &lsquo;It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth to
him good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When we see new opinions taking hold of men&rsquo;s minds; when we
see great changes becoming certain; then, instead of being angry and
terrified, we should say with Gamaliel the wise, &lsquo;Let them alone:
if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought; if it
be of God, you cannot overthrow it, lest haply you be found fighting
against God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If, again, we fancied ourselves aggrieved by any law, we should not
say, &lsquo;It is unjust, therefore I will not obey it:&rsquo; for it
would seem a small matter to us whether the law was unjust to us, which
only means, in most cases, that the law is hard on us personally, and
that we do not like it; for almost every one considers things just which
make for his own interest, while whatever is against his interest is
of course unjust.&nbsp; We should say, &lsquo;Let the law be hard on
me, yet I will obey it for the Lord&rsquo;s sake; if it can be altered
by fair and lawful means, well and good; but if not, I will take it
as one more burden which I am to bear patiently for the sake of him
who lays it on me, Christ my Lord and my King.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The true question with us ought to be, Does the law force us to do
that which is wrong?</p>
<p>If so, we are bound not to obey it, as the Jews were bound not to
obey the law which commanded C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s image to be set up
in the Temple.&nbsp; But if any man knows of a law in this land which
compels him to do a wrong thing, I know of none.&nbsp; And let no man
fancy that such submission shows a slavish spirit.&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp;
St. Peter did not wish to encourage a slavish spirit in Jews and Christians.&nbsp;
He told them that they were free: but that they were not to use that
belief as a cloak of maliciousness - of spiteful, bitter, and turbulent
conduct.&nbsp; And as a fact, those who have done most for true freedom,
in all ages, have not been the violent, noisy, bitter, rebellious spirits,
who have cried, &lsquo;We are the masters, who shall rule over us?&rsquo;
but the God-fearing, patient, law-abiding men, who would obey every
ordinance of man for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, whether it seemed to them
altogether just or not, unless they saw it was ruinous not to themselves
merely, but to their country, and to their children after them.</p>
<p>It is because men in their own minds do not believe that Christ is
the ruler of the world, that they lose all hope of God&rsquo;s delivering
them, and break out into mad rebellion.&nbsp; It is because, again,
men do not believe that Christ is the ruler of the world, that, when
their rebellion has failed, they sink into slavishness and dull despair,
and bow their necks to the yoke of the first tyrant who arises; and
try to make a covenant with death and hell.&nbsp; Better far for them,
had they made a covenant with Christ, who is ready to deliver men from
death and hell in this world, as well as in the world to come.</p>
<p>But he who believes in Christ, in the living Christ, the ordering
Christ, the governing Christ, will possess his soul in patience.&nbsp;
He will not fret himself, lest he should do evil; because he can always
put his trust in the Lord, until the tyranny be overpast.&nbsp; He will
not hastily rebel: but neither will he truckle basely and cowardly to
the ways of this wicked world.&nbsp; For Christ the Lord hates those
ways, and has judged them, and doomed them to destruction; and he reigns,
and will reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</p>

<h2>SERMON XVI. - TERROR BY NIGHT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(<i>Preached in Lent</i>.)</p>
<p>PSALM xci. 5.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night.</p>
<p>You may see, if you will read your Bible, that the night is spoken
of in the Old Testament much as we speak of it now, as a beautiful and
holy thing.&nbsp; The old Jews were not afraid of any terror by night.&nbsp;
They rejoiced to consider the heavens, the work of God&rsquo;s fingers,
the moon and the stars, which he had ordained.&nbsp; They looked on
night, as we do, as a blessed time of rest and peace for men, in which
the beasts of the forest seek their meat from God, while all things
are springing and growing, man knows not how, under the sleepless eye
of a good and loving Creator.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, you may remark that St. Paul, in his Epistles,
speaks of night in a very different tone.&nbsp; He is always opposing
night to day, and darkness to light; as if darkness was evil in itself,
and a pattern of all evil in men&rsquo;s souls.&nbsp; And St. Paul knew
what he was saying, and knew how to say it; for he spoke by the Holy
Spirit of God.</p>
<p>The reason of this difference is simple.&nbsp; The old Jews spoke
of God&rsquo;s night, such as we country folks may see, thank God, as
often as we will.&nbsp; St. Paul spoke of man&rsquo;s night, such as
it might be seen, alas! in the cities of the Roman empire.&nbsp; All
those to whom he wrote - Romans, Corinthians, Ephesians, and the rest
- dwelt in great cities, heathen and profligate; and night in them was
mixed up with all that was ugly, dangerous, and foul.&nbsp; They were
bad enough by day: after sunset, they became hells on earth.&nbsp; The
people, high and low, were sunk in wickedness; the lower classes in
poverty, and often despair.&nbsp; The streets were utterly unlighted;
and in the darkness robbery, house-breaking, murder, were so common,
that no one who had anything to lose went through the streets without
his weapon or a guard; while inside the houses, things went on at night
- works of darkness - of which no man who knows of them dare talk.&nbsp;
For as St. Paul says, &lsquo;It is a shame even to speak of those things
which are done by them in secret.&rsquo;&nbsp; Evil things are done
by night still, in London, Paris, New York, and many a great city; but
they are pure, respectable, comfortable, and happy, when compared with
one of those old heathen cities, which St. Paul knew but too well.</p>
<p>Again.&nbsp; Our own forefathers were afraid of the night and its
terrors, and looked on night as on an ugly time: but for very different
reasons from those for which St. Paul warned his disciples of night
and the works of darkness.&nbsp; Though they lived in the country, they
did not rejoice in God&rsquo;s heaven, or in the moon and stars which
he had ordained.&nbsp; They fancied that the night was the time in which
all ghastly and ugly phantoms began to move; that it was peopled with
ghosts, skeletons, demons, witches, who held revels on the hill-tops,
or stole into houses to suck the life out of sleeping men.&nbsp; The
cry of the wild fowl, and the howling of the wind, were to them the
yells of evil spirits.&nbsp; They dared not pass a graveyard by night
for fear of seeing things of which we will not talk.&nbsp; They fancied
that the forests, the fens, the caves, were full of spiteful and ugly
spirits, who tempted men to danger and to death; and when they prayed
to be delivered from the perils and dangers of the night, they prayed
not only against those real dangers of fire, of robbers, of sudden sickness,
and so forth, against which we all must pray, but against a thousand
horrible creatures which the good God never created, but which their
own fancy had invented.</p>
<p>Now in the Bible, from beginning to end, you will find no teaching
of this kind.&nbsp; That there are angels, and that there are also evil
spirits, the Bible says distinctly; and that they can sometimes appear
to men.&nbsp; But it is most worthy of remark how little the Bible says
about them, not how much; how it keeps them, as it were, in the background,
instead of bringing them forward; while our forefathers seem continually
talking of them, continually bringing them forward - I had almost said
they thought of nothing else.&nbsp; If you compare the Holy Bible with
the works which were most popular among our forefathers, especially
among the lower class, till within the last 200 years, you will see
at once what I mean, - how ghosts, apparitions, demons, witchcraft,
are perpetually spoken of in them; how seldom they are spoken of in
the Bible; lest, I suppose, men should think of them rather than of
God, as our forefathers seem to have been but too much given to do.</p>
<p>And so with this Psalm.&nbsp; It takes for granted that men will
have terrors by night; that they will be at times afraid of what may
come to them in the darkness.&nbsp; But it tells them not to be afraid,
for that as long as they say to God, &lsquo;Thou art my hope and my
stronghold; in thee will I trust,&rsquo; so long they will not be afraid
for any terror by night.</p>
<p>It was because our forefathers did not say that, that they were afraid,
and the terror by night grew on them; till at times it made them half
mad with fear of ghosts, witches, demons, and such-like; and with the
madness of fear came the madness of cruelty; and they committed, again
and again, such atrocities as I will not speak of here; crimes for which
we must trust that God has forgiven them, for they knew not what they
did.</p>
<p>But, though we happily no longer believe in the terror by night which
comes from witches, demons, or ghosts, there is another kind of terror
by night in which we must believe, for it comes to us from God, and
should be listened to as the voice of God: even that terror about our
own sinfulness, folly, weakness which comes to us in dreams or in sleepless
nights.&nbsp; Some will say, &lsquo;These painful dreams, these painful
waking thoughts, are merely bodily, and can be explained by bodily causes,
known to physicians.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whether they can or not, matters very
little to you and me.&nbsp; Things may be bodily, and yet teach us spiritual
lessons.&nbsp; A book - the very Bible itself - is a bodily thing: bodily
leaves of paper, printed with bodily ink; and yet out of it we may learn
lessons for our souls of the most awful and eternal importance.&nbsp;
And so with these night fancies and night thoughts.&nbsp; We may learn
from them.&nbsp; We are forced often to learn from them, whether we
will or not.&nbsp; They are often God&rsquo;s message to us, calling
us to repentance and amendment of life.&nbsp; They are often God&rsquo;s
book of judgment, wherein our sins are written, which God is setting
before us, and showing us the things which we have done.</p>
<p>Who that has come to middle age does not know how dreams sometimes
remind him painfully of what he once was, of what he would be still,
without God&rsquo;s grace?&nbsp; How in his dreams he finds himself
tempted by the old sins; giving way to the old meannesses, weaknesses,
follies?&nbsp; How dreams remind him, awfully enough, that though his
circumstances have changed, - his opinions, his whole manner of life,
have changed - yet he is still the same person that he was ten, twenty,
thirty, forty years ago, and will be for ever?&nbsp; Nothing bears witness
to the abiding, enduring, immortal oneness of the soul like dreams when
they prove to a man, in a way which cannot be mistaken - that is, by
making him do the deed over again in fancy - that he is the same person
who told that lie, felt that hatred, many a year ago; and who would
do the same again, if God&rsquo;s grace left him to that weak and sinful
nature, which is his master in sleep, and runs riot in his dreams.&nbsp;
Whether God sends to men in these days dreams which enable them to look
forward, and to foretell things to come, I cannot say.&nbsp; But this
I can say, that God sends dreams to men which enable them to look back,
and recollect things past, which they had forgotten only too easily;
and that these humbling and penitential dreams are God&rsquo;s warning
that (as the Article says) the infection of nature doth remain, even
in those who are regenerate; that nothing but the continual help of
God&rsquo;s Spirit will keep us from falling back, or falling away.</p>
<p>Again: those sad thoughts which weigh on the mind when lying awake
at night, when all things look black to a man; when he is more ashamed
of himself, more angry with himself, more ready to take the darkest
view of his own character and of his own prospects of life, than he
ever is by day, - do not these thoughts, too, come from God?&nbsp; Is
it not God who is holding the man&rsquo;s eyes waking?&nbsp; Is it not
God who is making him search out his own heart, and commune with his
spirit?&nbsp; I believe that so it is.&nbsp; If any one says, &lsquo;It
is all caused by the darkness and silence.&nbsp; You have nothing to
distract your attention as you have by day, and therefore the mind becomes
unwholesomely excited, and feeds upon itself,&rsquo; I answer, then
they are good things, now and then, this darkness and this silence,
if they do prevent the mind from being distracted, as it is all day
long, by business and pleasure; if they leave a man&rsquo;s soul alone
with itself, to look itself in the face, and be thoroughly ashamed of
what it sees.&nbsp; In the noise and glare of the day, we are all too
apt to fancy that all is right with us, and say, &lsquo;I am rich, and
increased with goods, and have need of nothing;&rsquo; and the night
does us a kindly office if it helps us to find out that we knew not
that we were poor, and miserable, and blind, and naked - not only in
the sight of God, but in our own sight, when we look honestly at ourselves.</p>
<p>The wise man says:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, would some power the gift but give us,<br />To see ourselves
as others see us!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and those painful thoughts make us do that.&nbsp; For if we see some
faults in ourselves, be sure our neighbours see them likewise, and perhaps
many more beside.</p>
<p>But more: these sad thoughts make us see ourselves as God sees us.&nbsp;
For if we see faults in ourselves, we may be sure that the pure and
holy God, in whose sight the very heavens are not clean, and who charges
his angels with folly, sees our faults with infinitely greater clearness,
and in infinitely greater number.&nbsp; So let us face those sad night
thoughts, however painful, however humiliating they may be; for by them
God is calling us to repentance, and forcing us to keep Lent in spirit
and in truth, whether we keep it outwardly or not.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What,&rsquo; some may say, &lsquo;you would have us, then,
afraid of the terror by night?&rsquo;&nbsp; My dear friends, that is
exactly what I would not have.&nbsp; I would teach you from Holy Scripture
how to profit by the terror, how to thank God for the terror, instead
of being afraid of it, as you otherwise certainly will be.&nbsp; For
these ugly dreams, these sad thoughts do come, whether you choose or
not.&nbsp; Whether you choose or not, you all have, or will have seasons
of depression, of anxiety, of melancholy.&nbsp; Shall they teach you,
or merely terrify you?&nbsp; Shall they only bring remorse, or shall
they bring repentance?</p>
<p>Remorse.&nbsp; In that is nothing but pain.&nbsp; A man may see all
the wrong and folly he has done; he may fret over it, torment himself
with it, curse himself for it, and yet be the worse, and not the better,
for what he sees.&nbsp; If he be a strong-minded man, he may escape
from remorse in the bustle of business or pleasure.&nbsp; If he be a
weak-minded man, he may escape from it in drunkenness, as hundreds do;
or he may fall into melancholy, superstition, despair, suicide.</p>
<p>But if his sadness breeds, not remorse, but repentance - that is,
in one word, if instead of keeping his sins to himself, he takes his
sins to God - then all will be well.&nbsp; Then he will not be afraid
of the terror, but thankful for it, when he knows that it is what St.
Paul calls, the terror of the Lord.</p>
<p>This is why the old Psalmists were not afraid of the terror by night;
because they knew that their anxiety had come from God, and therefore
went to God for forgiveness, for help, for comfort.&nbsp; Therefore
it is that one says, &lsquo;I am weary of groaning.&nbsp; Every night
wash I my bed, and water my couch with my tears,&rsquo; and yet says
the next moment, &lsquo;Away from me, all ye that work vanity.&nbsp;
The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.&nbsp; The Lord will receive
my prayer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Therefore it is that another says, &lsquo;While I held my sins my
bones waxed old through my daily complaining;&rsquo; and the next moment
- &lsquo;I said I will confess my sins unto the Lord, and so thou forgavest
the wickedness of my sin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Therefore it is that again another says, &lsquo;Thou holdest mine
eyes waking.&nbsp; I am so feeble that I cannot speak.&nbsp; I call
to remembrance my sin, and in the night season I commune with my heart,
and search out my spirit.&nbsp; Will the Lord absent himself for ever,
and will he be no more entreated?&nbsp; Is his mercy clean gone for
ever, and his promise come utterly to an end for evermore?&nbsp; And
I said, It is mine own infirmity; but I will remember the years of the
right hand of the most Highest.&nbsp; I will remember the works of the
Lord, and call to mind the wonders of old.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And another, &lsquo;Why art thou so heavy, O my soul, and why art
thou so disquieted within me?&nbsp; O put thy trust in God, for I shall
yet give him thanks, who is the help of my countenance, and my God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And therefore it is, that our Lord Jesus Christ, in order that he
might taste sorrow for every man, and be made in all things like to
his brethren, endured, once and for all, in the garden of Gethsemane,
the terror which cometh by night, as none ever endured it before or
since; the agony of dread, the agony of helplessness, in which he prayed
yet more earnestly, and his sweat was as great drops of blood falling
down to the ground.&nbsp; And there appeared an angel from heaven strengthening
him; because he stood not on his own strength, but cast himself on his
Father and our Father, on his God and our God.&nbsp; So says St. Paul,
who tells us how our Lord, in the days of his flesh, when he had offered
up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, unto him
that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared
- though he were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which
he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the Author of everlasting
salvation unto all them that obey him.</p>
<p>Oh, may we all, in the hour of shame and sadness, in the hour of
darkness and confusion, and, above all, in the hour of death and the
day of judgment, take refuge with him in whom alone is help, and comfort,
and salvation for this life and the life to come - even Jesus Christ,
who died for us on the cross.</p>

<h2>SERMON XVII. - THE SON OF THUNDER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>ST. JOHN i. 1.</p>
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God.</p>
<p>We read this morning the first chapter of the Gospel according to
St. John.</p>
<p>Some of you, I am sure, must have felt, as you heard it, how grand
was the very sound of the words.&nbsp; Some one once compared the sound
of St. John&rsquo;s Gospel to a great church bell: simple, slow, and
awful; and awful just because it is so simple and slow.&nbsp; The words
are very short, - most of them of one syllable, - so that even a child
may understand them if he will: but every word is full of meaning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.&nbsp; The same was in the beginning with God.&nbsp;
All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that
was made.&nbsp; In him was life; and the life was the light of men.&nbsp;
And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it
not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Those, I hold, are perhaps the deepest words ever written by man.&nbsp;
Whole books have been written, and whole books more might be written
upon them, and on the words which come after them.&nbsp; &lsquo;That
was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.&nbsp;
He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew
him not.&nbsp; He came unto his own, and his own received him not.&nbsp;
But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons
of God, even to them that believe on his name: which were born, not
of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
of God.&nbsp; And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we
beheld his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father),
full of grace and truth.&rsquo;&nbsp; They go down to the mystery of
all mysteries, - to the mystery of the unfathomable One God, who dwells
alone in the light which none can approach unto, self-sustained and
self-sufficing for ever.&nbsp; And then they go on to the other great
mystery - how that God comes forth out of himself to give life and light
to all things which he has made; and what is the bond between the Abysmal
Father in heaven, and us his human children, and the world in which
we live:- even Jesus Christ, God of the substance of his Father, begotten
before the worlds, and man of the substance of his mother, born in the
world.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; The root and ground of all true philosophy lies in this
chapter.&nbsp; Its words are so deep that the wisest man might spend
his life over them without finding out all that they mean.&nbsp; And
yet they are so simple that any child can understand enough of their
meaning to know its duty, and to do it.</p>
<p>Remark, again, how short the sentences are.&nbsp; Each is made up
of a very few words, and followed by a full stop, that our minds may
come to a full stop likewise, and think over what we have heard before
St. John goes on to tell us more.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; St. John does not hurry either himself or us.&nbsp; He
takes his time; and he wishes us to take our time likewise.&nbsp; His
message will keep; for it is eternal.&nbsp; It is not a story of yesterday,
or to-day, or to-morrow.&nbsp; It is the story of eternity, - of what
is, and was, and always will be.</p>
<p>Always has the Word been with God, and always will he be God.</p>
<p>Always has the Word been making all things, and always will he be
making.</p>
<p>Always has the Spirit been proceeding, and always will the Spirit
be proceeding, from the Word and from the Father of the Word, giving
their light and their life to men.</p>
<p>St. John&rsquo;s message will last for ever; and therefore he tells
it slowly and deliberately, knowing that no time can change what he
has to say; for it is the good news of the Word, Jesus Christ, who is
the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever, because he is God of very
God, eternally in the bosom of the Father.</p>
<p>Now St. John, who writes thus simply and quietly, was no weak or
soft person.&nbsp; He was one of the two whom the Lord surnamed Boanerges,
the Son of Thunder - the man of the loud and awful voice.&nbsp; Painters
have liked to draw St. John as young, soft, and feminine, because he
was the Apostle of Love.&nbsp; I beg you to put that sentimental notion
out of your minds, and to remember that the only hint which Holy Scripture
gives us about St. John&rsquo;s person is, that he was &lsquo;a Son
of Thunder;&rsquo; that his very voice, when he chose, was awful; that
he, and his brother James, before they were converted, were not of a
soft, but of a terrible temper; that it was James and John, the Sons
of Thunder, who wanted to call down thunder and lightning from heaven
on all the villages who would not receive the Lord.</p>
<p>A Son of Thunder.&nbsp; Think over that name, and think over it carefully,
remembering that it was our Lord himself who gave St. John the name;
and that it therefore has, surely, some deep meaning.</p>
<p>Do not fancy that it means merely a loud and noisy person.&nbsp;
I have known too many, carelessly looking only at the outsides and shows
of things, and not at their inside and reality, fancy that that was
what it meant.&nbsp; I have known them fancy that they themselves were
sons of thunder when they raved and shouted, and used violent language,
in preaching, or in public speaking.&nbsp; And I have heard foolish
people honour such men the more, and think them the more in earnest,
the more noise they made, and say of him; &lsquo;He is a true Boanerges
- a Son of Thunder, like St. John.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Like St. John?&nbsp; The only sermon of St. John&rsquo;s which we
have on record is that which they say he used to preach over and over
again when he was carried as an old man into his church at Ephesus.&nbsp;
And that was no more than these few words over and over again, Sunday
after Sunday, &lsquo;Little children, love one another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That was the way in which St. John, the Son of Thunder, spoke when
age and long obedience to the Spirit of God had taught him how to use
his strength wisely and well.</p>
<p>Like St. John?&nbsp; Is there anywhere, in St. John&rsquo;s Gospel
or Epistles, one violent expression?&nbsp; One sentence of great swelling
words?&nbsp; Are not the words of the Son of Thunder, as I have been
telling you, peculiarly calm, slow, simple, gentle?&nbsp; Can those
whose mouths are full of noisy and violent talk, be true Sons of Thunder,
if St. John was one?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; And if you will think for yourselves, you will see that
there is a deeper meaning in our Lord&rsquo;s name for St. John than
merely that he was a loud and violent man.</p>
<p>You hear the roar of the thunder, but you know surely that it is
not the thunder itself; that it is only its echo rolling on from cloud
to cloud and hill from hill.</p>
<p>But the thunder itself - if you have ever been close enough to it
to hear it - is very different from that, and far more awful.&nbsp;
Still and silently it broods till its time is come.&nbsp; And then there
is one ear-piercing crack, one blinding flash, and all is over.&nbsp;
Nothing so swift, so instantaneous, as the thunder itself, and yet nothing
so strong.</p>
<p>And such are those sudden flashes of indignation against sin and
falsehood which break out for a moment in St. John&rsquo;s writing,
piercing, like the Word of God himself, the very joints and marrow of
the heart, and showing, in one terrible word, what is the real matter
with the bad man&rsquo;s soul; as the thunderbolt lights up for an instant
the whole heavens far and wide.&nbsp; &lsquo;If we say that we have
fellowship with God, and walk in darkness, we lie.&rsquo;&nbsp; In that
one plain, ugly word, he tells us the whole truth, frightful as it is,
and then he goes on calmly once more.&nbsp; And again:</p>
<p>&lsquo;He that saith, I know God, and keepeth not his commandments,
is a liar.&nbsp; He that committeth sin is of the devil.&nbsp; He that
hateth his brother is a murderer.&nbsp; If a man say, I love God, and
hateth his brother, he is a liar; for he that loveth not his brother
whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?&nbsp;
He that doeth good is of God; but he that doeth evil has not seen God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such words as these, coming as they do amid the usually quiet and
gentle language of St. John - these are truly words of thunder; going
straight to their mark, tearing off the mask from hypocrisy and self-deceiving
and false religion, and speaking the truth in majesty.</p>
<p>And yet there is no noisiness, no wordiness, about them; nothing
like rant or violence.&nbsp; Such a man is a liar, says St. John: but
he says no more.&nbsp; That is all, and that is enough.</p>
<p>So speaks the true Son of Thunder.&nbsp; And his words, like the
thunder, echo from land to land; and we hear them now, this day, in
a foreign tongue, eighteen hundred years after they were written: while
thousands of bigger, noisier, and frothier words and more violent books
have been lost and forgotten utterly.</p>
<p>And now, my friends, we may find in St. John&rsquo;s example a wholesome
lesson for ourselves.&nbsp; We may learn from it that noisiness is not
earnestness, that violence is not strength.&nbsp; Noise is a sign of
want of faith, and violence is a sign of weakness.</p>
<p>The man who is really in earnest, who has real faith in what he is
saying and doing, will not be noisy, and loud, and in a hurry, as it
is written, &lsquo;He that believeth will not make haste.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He that is really strong; he who knows that he can do his work, if he
takes his time and uses his wit, and God prospers him - he will not
be violent, but will work on in silence and peaceful industry, as it
is written, &lsquo;Thy strength is to sit still.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I know that you here do not require this warning much for yourselves.&nbsp;
There is, thank God, something in our quiet, industrious, country life
which breeds in men that solid, sober temper, the temper which produces
much work and little talk, which is the mark of a true Englishman, a
true gentleman, and a true Christian.</p>
<p>But if you go (as more and more of you will go) into the great towns,
you will hear much noisy and violent speaking from pulpits, and at public
meetings.&nbsp; You will read much noisy and violent writing in newspapers
and books.</p>
<p>Now I say to you, distrust such talk.&nbsp; It may seem to you very
earnest and passionate.&nbsp; Distrust it for that very reason.&nbsp;
It may seem to you very eloquent and full of fine words.&nbsp; Distrust
it for that very reason.&nbsp; The man who cannot tell his story without
wrapping it up in fine words, generally does not know very clearly what
he is talking about.&nbsp; The man who cannot speak or write without
scolding and exaggeration, is not very likely to be able to give sound
advice to his fellow-men.</p>
<p>Remember that it is by violent language of this kind, in all ages,
that fanatical preachers have deceived silly men and women to their
shame and ruin; and mob-leaders have stirred up riots and horrible confusions.&nbsp;
Remember this: and distrust violent and wordy persons wheresoever you
shall meet them: but after listening to them, if you must, go home,
and take out your Bibles, and read the Gospel of St. John, and see how
he spoke, the true Son of Thunder, whose words are gone out into all
lands, and their sound unto the end of the world, just because they
are calm and sober, plain and simple, like the words of Jesus Christ
his Lord and our Lord, who spake as never man spake.</p>
<p>And for ourselves - let us remember our Lord&rsquo;s own warning:
&lsquo;Let your Yea be Yea, and your Nay Nay; for whatsoever is more
than these cometh of evil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tell your story plainly and calmly; speak your mind if you must.&nbsp;
But speak it quietly.&nbsp; Do not try to make out the worst case for
your adversary; do not exaggerate; do not use strong language: say the
truth, the whole truth; but say nothing but the truth, in patience and
in charity.&nbsp; For everything beyond that comes of evil, - of some
evil or fault in us.&nbsp; Either we are not quite sure that we are
right; or we have lost our temper, and then we see the whole matter
awry, through the mist of passion; or we are selfish, and looking out
for our own interest, or our own credit, instead of judging the matter
fairly.&nbsp; This, or something else, is certainly wrong in us whenever
we give way to violent language.&nbsp; Therefore, whenever we are tempted
to say more than is needful, let us remember St. John&rsquo;s words,
and ask God for his Holy Spirit, the spirit of love, which, instead
of weakening a man&rsquo;s words, makes them all the stronger in the
cause of truth, because they are spoken in love.</p>

<h2>SERMON XVIII. - HUMILITY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>LUKE v. 8.</p>
<p>Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</p>
<p>Few stories in the New Testament are as well known as this.&nbsp;
Few go home more deeply to the heart of man.&nbsp; Most simple, most
graceful is the story, and yet it has in it depths unfathomable.</p>
<p>Great painters have loved to draw, great poets have loved to sing,
that scene on the lake of Gennesaret.&nbsp; The clear blue water, land-locked
with mountains; the meadows on the shore, gay with their lilies of the
field, on which our Lord bade them look, and know the bounty of their
Father in heaven; the rich gardens, olive-yards, and vineyards on the
slopes; the towns and villas scattered along the shore, all of bright
white limestone, gay in the sun; the crowds of boats, fishing continually
for the fish which swarm to this day in the lake; - everywhere beautiful
country life, busy and gay, healthy and civilized likewise - and in
the midst of it, the Maker of all heaven and earth sitting in a poor
fisher&rsquo;s boat, and condescending to tell them where the shoal
of fish was lying.&nbsp; It is a wonderful scene.&nbsp; Let us thank
God that it happened once on earth.&nbsp; Let us try to see what we
may learn from it in these days, in which our God and Saviour no longer
walks this earth in human form.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; some may say, &lsquo;but for that very reason there
is no lesson in the story for us in these days.&nbsp; True it is, that
God does not walk the earth now in human form.&nbsp; He works no miracles,
either for fishermen, or for any other men.&nbsp; We shall never see
a miraculous draught of fishes.&nbsp; We shall never be convinced, as
St. Peter was, by a miracle, that Christ is close to us.&nbsp; What
has the story to do with us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>My friends, are things, after all, so different now from what they
were then?&nbsp; Is our case after all so very different from St. Peter&rsquo;s?&nbsp;
God and Christ cannot change, for they are eternal - the same yesterday,
to-day, and for ever; and if Christ was near St. Peter on the lake of
Gennesaret, he is near us now, and here; for in him we live and move
and have our being; and he is about our path, and about our bed, and
spieth out all our ways: near us for ever, whether we know it or not.&nbsp;
And human nature cannot change.&nbsp; There is in us the same heart
as there was in St. Peter, for evil and for good.&nbsp; When St. Peter
found suddenly that it was the Lord who was in his boat, his first feeling
was one of fear: &lsquo;Depart from me for I am a sinful man, O Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And when we recollect at moments that God is close to us, watching all
we do, all we say, yea, all we think, are we not afraid, for the moment
at least?&nbsp; Do we not feel the thought of God&rsquo;s presence a
burden?&nbsp; Do we never long to hide from God? - to forget God again,
and cry in our hearts: &lsquo;Depart from me; for I am a sinful man,
O Lord&rsquo;?</p>
<p>God grant to us all, that after that first feeling of dread and awe
is over, we may go on, as St. Peter went on, to the better feelings
of admiration, loyalty, worship and say at last, as St. Peter said afterwards,
when the Lord asked him if he too would leave him: &lsquo;Lord, to whom
shall we go? for thou hast the words of eternal life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But do I blame St. Peter for saying, &lsquo;Depart from me; for I
am a sinful man, O Lord&rsquo;?&nbsp; God forbid!&nbsp; Who am I, to
blame St. Peter?&nbsp; Especially when even the Lord Jesus did not blame
him, but only bade him not to be afraid.</p>
<p>And why did the Lord not blame him, even when he asked Him to go
away?</p>
<p>Because St. Peter was honest.&nbsp; He said frankly and naturally
what was in his heart.&nbsp; And honesty, even if it is mistaken, never
offends God, and ought never to offend men.&nbsp; God requires truth
in the inward parts; and if a man speaks the truth - if he expresses
his own thoughts and feelings frankly and honestly - then, even if he
is not right, he is at least on the only road to get right, as St. Peter
was.</p>
<p>He spoke not from dislike of our Lord, but from modesty; from a feeling
of awe, of uneasiness, of dread, at the presence of one who was infinitely
greater, wiser, better than himself.</p>
<p>And that feeling of reverence and modesty, even when it takes the
shape, as it often will in young people, of shyness and fear, is a divine
and noble feeling - the beginning of all goodness.&nbsp; Indeed, I question
whether there can be any real and sound goodness in any man&rsquo;s
heart, if he has no modesty, and no reverence.&nbsp; Boldness, forwardness,
self-conceit, above all in the young - we know how ugly they are in
our eyes; and the Bible tells us again and again how ugly they are in
the sight of God.</p>
<p>The truly great and free and noble soul - and St. Peter&rsquo;s soul
was such - is that of the man who feels awe and reverence in the presence
of those who are wiser and holier than himself; who is abashed and humbled
when he compares himself with his betters, just because his standard
is so high.&nbsp; Because he knows how much better he should be than
he is; because he is discontented with himself, ashamed of himself,
therefore he shrinks, at first, from the very company which, after a
while, he learns to like best, because it teaches him most.&nbsp; And
so it was with St. Peter&rsquo;s noble soul.&nbsp; He felt himself,
in the presence of that pure Christ, a sinful man:- not perhaps what
we should call sinful; but sinful in comparison of Christ.&nbsp; He
felt his own meanness, ignorance, selfishness, weakness.&nbsp; He felt
unworthy to be in such good company.&nbsp; He felt unworthy, - he, the
ignorant fisherman, - to have such a guest in his poor boat.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go
elsewhere, Lord,&rsquo; he tried to say, &lsquo;to a place and to companions
more fit for thee.&nbsp; I am ashamed to stand in thy presence.&nbsp;
I am dazzled by the brightness of thy countenance, crushed down by the
thought of thy wisdom and power, uneasy lest I say or do something unfit
for thee; lest I anger thee unawares in my ignorance, clumsiness; lest
I betray to thee my own bad habits: and those bad habits I feel in thy
presence as I never felt before.&nbsp; Thou art too condescending; thou
honourest me too much; thou hast taken me for a better man than I am;
thou knowest not what a poor miserable creature I am at heart - &ldquo;Depart
from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>There spoke out the truly noble soul, who was ready the next moment,
as soon as he had recovered himself, to leave all and follow Christ;
who was ready afterwards to wander, to suffer, to die upon the cross
for his Lord; and who, when he was led out to execution, asked to be
crucified (as it is said St. Peter actually did) with his head downwards;
for it was too much honour for him to die looking up to heaven, as his
Lord had died.</p>
<p>Do you not understand me yet?&nbsp; Then think what you would have
thought of St. Peter, if, instead of saying, &lsquo;Depart from me;
for I am a sinful man, O Lord,&rsquo; St. Peter had said, &lsquo;Stay
with me, for I am a holy man, O Lord.&nbsp; I am just the sort of person
who deserves the honour of thy company; and my boat, poor though it
is, more fit for thee than the palace of a king.&rsquo;&nbsp; Would
St. Peter have seemed to you then wiser or more foolish, better or worse,
than he does now, when in his confused honest humility, he begs the
Lord to go away and leave him?&nbsp; And do you not feel that a man
is (as a great poet says) &lsquo;displeasing alike to God and to the
enemies of God,&rsquo; when he comes boldly to the throne of grace,
not to find grace and mercy, because he feels that he needs them: but
to boast of God&rsquo;s grace, and make God&rsquo;s mercy to him an
excuse for looking down upon his fellow-creatures; and worships, like
the Pharisee, in self-conceit and pride, thanking God that he is not
as other men are?</p>
<p>Better far to be the publican, who stood afar off, and dare not lift
up as much as his eyes toward heaven, but cried only, &lsquo;God be
merciful to me a sinner.&rsquo;&nbsp; Better far to be the honest and
devout soldier, who, when Jesus offered to come to his house, answered,
&lsquo;Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.&nbsp;
But speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Only he must say that in honesty, in spirit, and in truth, like St.
Peter.&nbsp; For a man may shrink from religion, from the thought of
God, from coming to the Holy Communion, for two most opposite reasons.</p>
<p>He may shrink from them because he knows he is full of sins, and
wishes to keep his sins; and knows that, if he worships God, if he comes
to the Holy Communion - indeed, if he remembers the presence of God
at all, - he pledges himself to give up his bad habits; to repent and
amend, which is just what he has no mind to do.&nbsp; So he turns away
from God, because he chooses to remain bad.&nbsp; May the Lord have
mercy on his soul, for he has no mercy on it himself!&nbsp; He chooses
evil, and refuses good; and evil will be his ruin.</p>
<p>But, again, a man may shrink from God, from church, from the Holy
Communion, because he feels himself bad, and longs to be good; because
he feels himself full of evil habits, and hates them, and sees how ugly
they are, and is afraid to appear in the presence of God foul with sin.</p>
<p>Let him be of good cheer.&nbsp; He is not going wrong wilfully.&nbsp;
But he is making a mistake.&nbsp; Let him make it no more.&nbsp; He
feels himself unworthy.&nbsp; Let him come all the more, that he may
be made worthy.&nbsp; Let him come, because he is worthy.&nbsp; For
- strange it may seem, but true it is - that a man is the more worthy
to draw near to God the more he feels himself to be utterly unworthy
thereof.</p>
<p>He who partakes worthily of the Holy Communion is he who says with
his whole heart, &lsquo;We are not worthy so much as to gather up the
crumbs under thy table.&rsquo;&nbsp; He with whom Christ will take up
his abode is he who says, &lsquo;Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest
enter under my roof.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For humility is the beginning of all goodness, and the end of all
wisdom.</p>
<p>He who says that he sees is blind.&nbsp; He who knows his own blindness
sees.&nbsp; He who says he has no sin in him is the sinner.&nbsp; He
who confesses his sins is the righteous man; for God is faithful and
just to forgive him, as he did St. Peter, and to cleanse him from all
unrighteousness.</p>

<h2>SERMON XIX. - A WHITSUN SERMON</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>PSALM civ. 24, 27-30.</p>
<p>O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them
all: the earth is full of thy riches. . . .&nbsp; These wait all upon
thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.&nbsp; That
thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled
with good.&nbsp; Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest
away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.&nbsp; Thou sendest
forth thy Spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the
earth.</p>
<p>You may not understand why I read this morning, instead of the <i>Te
Deum</i>, the &lsquo;Song of the three Children,&rsquo; which calls
on all powers and creatures in the world to bless and praise God.&nbsp;
You may not understand also, at first, why this grand 104th Psalm was
chosen as one of the special Psalms for Whitsuntide, - what it has to
do with the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, the Spirit of God.&nbsp; Let
me try to explain it to you, and may God grant that you may find something
worth remembering among my clumsy words.</p>
<p>You were told this morning that there were two ways of learning concerning
God and the Spirit of God, - that one was by the hearing of the ear,
and the Holy Bible; the other by the seeing of the eye - by nature and
the world around us.&nbsp; It is of the latter I speak this afternoon,
- of what you can learn concerning God by seeing, if only you have eyes,
and the same Spirit of God to open those eyes, as the Psalmist had.</p>
<p>The man who wrote this Psalm looked round him on the wondrous world
in which we dwell, and all he saw in it spoke to him of God; of one
God, boundless in wisdom and in power, in love and care; and of one
Spirit of God, the Lord and Giver of Life.</p>
<p>He saw all this, and so glorious did it seem to him, as he looked
on the fair world round him, that he could not contain himself.&nbsp;
Not only was his reason satisfied, but his heart was touched.&nbsp;
It was so glorious that he could not speak of it coldly, calmly; and
he burst out into singing a song of praise - &lsquo;O Lord our God,
thou art become exceeding glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and
honour.&rsquo;&nbsp; For he saw everywhere order; all things working
together for good.&nbsp; He saw everywhere order and rule; and something
within him told him, there must be a Lawgiver, an Orderer, a Ruler and
he must be One.</p>
<p>Again, the Psalmist saw everywhere a purpose; things evidently created
to be of use to each other.&nbsp; And the Spirit of God told him there
must be One who purposed all this; who meant to do it, and who had done
it; who thought it out and planned it by wisdom and understanding.</p>
<p>Then the Psalmist saw how everything, from the highest to the lowest,
was of use.&nbsp; The fir trees were a dwelling for the stork; and the
very stony rocks, where nothing else can live, were a refuge for the
wild goats; everywhere he saw use and bounty - food, shelter, life,
happiness, given to man and beast, and not earned by them; then he said
- &lsquo;There must be a bountiful Lord, a Giver, generous and loving,
from whom the very lions seek their meat, when they roar after their
prey; on whom all the creeping things innumerable wait in the great
sea, that he may give them meat in due season.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, moreover, he saw everywhere beauty; shapes, and colours, and
sounds, which were beautiful in his eyes, and gave him pleasure deep
and strange, he knew not why: and the Spirit of God within him told
him - &lsquo;These fair things please thee.&nbsp; Do they not please
Him who made them?&nbsp; He that formed the ear, shall he not hear the
song of birds?&nbsp; He that made the eye, shall he not see the colours
of the flowers?&nbsp; He who made thee to rejoice in the beauty of the
earth, shall not he rejoice in his own works?&rsquo;&nbsp; And God seemed
to him, in his mind&rsquo;s eye, to delight in his own works, as a painter
delights in the picture which he has drawn, as a gardener delights in
the flowers which he has planted; as a cunning workman delights in the
curious machine which he has invented; as a king delights in the fair
parks and gardens and stately palaces which he has laid out, and builded,
and adorned, for his own pleasure, as well as for the good of his subjects.</p>
<p>And then, beneath all, and beyond all, there came to him another
question - What is life?</p>
<p>The painter paints his picture, but it has no life.&nbsp; The workman
makes his machine, but, though it moves and works, it has no life.&nbsp;
The gardener, - his flowers have life, but he has not given it to them;
he can only sow the seemingly dead seeds.&nbsp; Who is He that giveth
those seeds a body as it pleases him, and to every seed its own body,
its own growth of leaf, form, and colour?&nbsp; God alone.&nbsp; And
what is that life which he does give?&nbsp; Who can tell that?&nbsp;
What is life?&nbsp; What is it which changes the seed into a flower,
the egg into a bird?&nbsp; It is not the seed itself; the egg itself.&nbsp;
What power or will have they, over themselves?&nbsp; It is not in the
seed, or in the egg, as all now know from experience.&nbsp; You may
look for it with all the microscopes in the world, but you will not
find it.&nbsp; There is nothing to be found by the eyes of mortal man
which can account for the growth and life of any created thing.</p>
<p>And what is death?&nbsp; What does the live thing lose, when it loses
life?&nbsp; This moment the bird was alive; a tiny pellet of shot has
gone through its brain, and now its life is lost: but what is lost?&nbsp;
It is just the same size, shape, colour; it weighs exactly the same
as it did when alive.&nbsp; What is the thing not to be seen, touched,
weighed, described, or understood, which it has lost, which we call
life?</p>
<p>And to that deep question the Psalmist had an answer whispered to
him, - a hint only, as it were, in a parable.&nbsp; Life is the breath
of God.&nbsp; It is the Spirit of God, who is the Lord and Giver of
life.&nbsp; God breathes into things the breath of life.&nbsp; When
he takes away that breath they die, and are turned again to their dust.&nbsp;
When he lets his breath go forth again, they are made, and he renews
the face of the earth.</p>
<p>That is enough for thee, O man, to know.&nbsp; What life is thou
canst not know.&nbsp; Thou canst only speak of it in a figure - as the
breath, the Spirit of God.&nbsp; That Spirit of God is not the universe
itself.&nbsp; But he is working in all things, giving them form and
life, dividing to each severally as he will; all their shape, their
beauty, their powers, their instincts, their thoughts; all in them save
brute matter and dead dust: from him they come, and to him they return
again.&nbsp; All order, all law, all force, all usefulness, come from
him.&nbsp; He is the Lord and Giver of life, in whom all things live,
and move, and have their being.</p>
<p>Therefore, my friends, let us at all times, in all places, and especially
at this Whitsuntide, remember that all we see, or can see, except sin,
is the work of the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of God.&nbsp; Let us look
on the world around us, as what it is, as what the old Psalmist saw
it to be, - a sacred place, full of God&rsquo;s presence, shaped, quickened,
and guided by the Spirit of God, the Lord and Giver of life.</p>
<p>My dear friends, God grant that you may all learn to look upon this
world as the Psalmist looked on it.&nbsp; God grant that you may all
learn to see, each in your own way, what a great and pious poet of our
fathers&rsquo; time put into words far wiser and grander than any which
I can invent for you, when he said how, looking on the earth, the sea,
the sky, he felt -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;A presence that disturbs me with the joy<br />Of elevated
thoughts; a sense sublime<br />Of something far more deeply interfused,<br />Whose
dwelling is the light of setting suns,<br />And the round ocean, and
the living air,<br />And the blue sky, and in the mind of man:<br />A
motion and a spirit that impels<br />All thinking things, all objects
of all thought,<br />And rolls through all things.&nbsp; Therefore am
I still<br />A lover of the meadows and the woods<br />And mountains;
and of all that we behold<br />From this green earth; of all the mighty
world;<br />Of eye and ear, both what they half create<br />And what
perceive; well pleased to recognise<br />In nature and the language
of the sense<br />The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,<br />The
guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul<br />Of all my moral being.&rsquo;
<a name="citation243"></a><a href="#footnote243">{243}</a></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;Of all my moral being.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes; of our moral being, our characters, our souls.&nbsp; By looking
upon this beautiful and wonderful world around us with reverence, and
earnestness, and love, as what it is, - the work of God&rsquo;s Spirit,
- we shall become not merely the more learned, or the more happy, we
shall become actually better men.&nbsp; The beauties in the earth and
sky; the flowers with their fair hues and fragrant scents; the song
of birds; the green shaughs and woodlands; the moors purple with heath,
and golden with furze; the shapes of clouds, from the delicate mist
upon the lawn to the thunder pillar towering up in awful might; the
sunrise and sunset, painted by God afresh each morn and even; the blue
sky, which is the image of God the heavenly Father, boundless, clear,
and calm, looking down on all below with the same smile of love, sending
his rain alike on the evil and on the good, and causing his sun to shine
alike on the just and on the unjust:- he who watches all these things,
day by day, will find his heart grow quiet, sober, meek, contented.&nbsp;
His eyes will be turned away from beholding vanity.&nbsp; His soul will
be kept from vexation of spirit.&nbsp; In God&rsquo;s tabernacle, which
is the universe of all the worlds, he will be kept from the strife of
tongues.&nbsp; As he watches the work of God&rsquo;s Spirit, the beauty
of God&rsquo;s Spirit, the wisdom of God&rsquo;s Spirit, the fruitfulness
of God&rsquo;s Spirit, which shines forth in every wayside flower, and
every gnat which dances in the sun, he will rejoice in God&rsquo;s work,
even as God himself rejoices.&nbsp; He will learn to value things at
their true price, and see things of their real size.&nbsp; Ambition,
fame, money, will seem small things to him as he considers the lilies
of the field, how the heavenly Father clothes them, and the birds of
the air, how the heavenly Father feeds them; and he will say with the
wise man -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;All the windy ways of men<br />Are but dust that rises up,<br />And
is lightly laid again.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Dust, indeed, and not worthy the attention of the wise man, who considers
how the very heaven and earth shall perish, and yet God endure; how
- &lsquo;They all shall wax old as doth a garment, and as a vesture
shall God change them, and they shall be changed: but God is the same,
and his years shall not fail.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And as that man grows more quiet, he will grow more loving likewise;
more merciful to the very dumb animals.&nbsp; He will be ashamed even
to disturb a bird upon its nest, when he remembers the builder and maker
of that nest is not the bird alone, but God.&nbsp; He will believe the
words of the wise man -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;He prayeth well who loveth well<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both
man, and bird, and beast.<br />He prayeth best who loveth best<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
things, both great and small;<br />For the great God who loveth us,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
made and loveth all.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>More quiet, more loving will that man grow; and more pious likewise.&nbsp;
For there ought to come to that man a sense of God&rsquo;s presence,
of God&rsquo;s nearness, which will fill him with a wholesome fear of
God.&nbsp; As he sees with the inward eyes of his reason God&rsquo;s
Spirit at work for ever on every seed, on every insect, ay, on every
nerve and muscle of his own body, he will heartily say with the Psalmist
- &lsquo;I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully
made.&nbsp; Marvellous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right
well.&nbsp; Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; and
in thy book were all my members written, which day by day were fashioned,
when as yet there was none of them.&nbsp; Whither shall I go then from
thy Spirit, or whither shall I flee from thy presence?&nbsp; If I climb
up to heaven, thou art there; if I go down to hell, thou art there also;
if I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts
of the sea, even there thy hand shall lead me, and thy right hand hold
me still.&nbsp; If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me,
then shall my night be turned into day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes, God he will see is everywhere, over all, and through all, and
in all; and from God there is no escape.&nbsp; The only hope, the only
wisdom, is to open his heart to God as a child to its father, and cry
with the Psalmist - &lsquo;Try me, O God, and search the ground of my
heart; prove me, and examine my thoughts.&nbsp; Look well if there be
any way of wickedness in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My dear friends, take these thoughts home with you: and may God give
you grace to ponder over them, and so make your Whitsun holiday more
quiet, more pure, more full of lessons learnt from God&rsquo;s great
green book which lies outside for every man to read.&nbsp; Of such as
you said the wise heathen long ago - &lsquo;Too happy are they who till
the land, if they but knew the blessings which they have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And it is a blessing, a privilege, and therefore a responsibility
laid on you by your Father and your Saviour, to have such a fair, peaceful,
country scene around you, as you will behold when you leave this church,
- a scene where everything is to the wise man, where everything should
be to you, a witness of God&rsquo;s Spirit; a witness of God&rsquo;s
power, God&rsquo;s wisdom, God&rsquo;s care, God&rsquo;s love.&nbsp;
Go, and may God turn away your hearts from all that is mean and selfish,
all that is coarse and low, and lift them up unto himself, as you look
upon the fields, and woods, and sky, till you, too, say with the Psalmist
- &lsquo;O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made
them all: the earth is full of thy riches.&nbsp; I will praise my God
while I have my being; my joy shall be in the Lord.&rsquo;</p>

<h2>SERMON XX. - SELF-HELP</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>ST. JOHN xvi. 7.</p>
<p>It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the
Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto
you.</p>
<p>This is a deep and strange saying.&nbsp; How can it be expedient,
useful, or profitable, for any human being that Christ should go away
from them?&nbsp; To be in Christ&rsquo;s presence; to see his face;
to hear his voice; - would not this be the most expedient and profitable,
yea, the most blessed and blissful of things which could befall us?&nbsp;
Is it not that which saints hope to attain for ever in heaven - the
beatific vision of Christ?</p>
<p>My dear friends, one thing is certain, that Christ loves us far better
than we can love ourselves, and knows how to show that love.&nbsp; He
would have stayed with the apostles, instead of ascending into heaven,
if it had been expedient for them.&nbsp; Yea, if it had been expedient
for him to have stayed on earth among mankind unto this very day, he
would have stayed.</p>
<p>Because it was not expedient, not good for the apostles, not good
for mankind, that he should stay among them, therefore he ascended into
heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God, all authority and power
being given to him in heaven and in earth.</p>
<p>And he gives us a reason for so doing - only a hint; but still a
hint, by which we may see to-day it was expedient for us that he should
go away.</p>
<p>Unless he went away, the Comforter would not come.&nbsp; Now the
true and exact meaning of the Comforter is the Strengthener, the Encourager
- one who gives a man strength of mind, and courage of spirit, to do
his work.&nbsp; Without that Comforter, the apostles would be weak and
spiritless.&nbsp; Without being encouraged and inspirited by him, they
would never get through the work which they had to do, of preaching
the Gospel to the whole world.</p>
<p>We may surely see, if we think, some of the cause of this.&nbsp;
The apostles, till our Lord&rsquo;s ascension, had been following him
about like scholars following a master - almost like children holding
by their father&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; They had had no will of their own;
no opinion of their own; they had never had to judge for themselves,
or act for themselves; and, when they had tried to do so, they had always
been in the wrong, and Christ had rebuked them.&nbsp; They had been
like scholars, I say, with a teacher, or children with a parent.&nbsp;
Yea rather, when one remembers who they were, poor fishermen, and who
he was - God made man - they had been (I speak with all reverence) as
dogs at their master&rsquo;s side - faithful and intelligent truly;
but with no will of their own, looking for ever up to his hand and his
eye, to see what he would have them do.&nbsp; But that could not last.&nbsp;
It ought not to last.&nbsp; God does not wish us to be always as animals,
not even always as children; he wishes us to become men; perfect men,
who have their senses exercised by experience to discern good and evil.</p>
<p>And so it was to be with the apostles.&nbsp; They had to learn, as
we all have to learn, self-help, self-government, self-determination.&nbsp;
They were to think for themselves, and act for themselves; and yet not
by themselves.&nbsp; For he would put into them a spirit, even his Spirit;
and so, when they were thinking for themselves, they would be thinking
as he would have them think; when they were acting for themselves, they
would be acting as he would have them act.&nbsp; They would live; but
not their own life, for Christ would live in them.&nbsp; They would
speak: but not their own words; the Spirit of their Father would speak
in them; that so they might come in the unity of the faith, and the
knowledge of the Son of God, to be perfect men, to the measure of the
stature of the fulness of Christ.</p>
<p>My dear friends, this may seem deep and a mystery: but so are all
things in this wondrous life of ours.&nbsp; And surely we see a pattern
of all this in our own lives.&nbsp; Each child is educated - or ought
to be - as Christ educated his apostles.</p>
<p>Have we not had, some of us, in early life some parent, friend, teacher,
spiritual pastor, or master, to whom we looked up with unbounded respect?&nbsp;
His word to us was law.&nbsp; His counsel was as the oracles of God.&nbsp;
We did not dream of thinking for ourselves, acting for ourselves, while
we had him to tell us how to think, how to act; and we were happy in
our devotion.&nbsp; We felt what a blessed thing, not merely protecting
and guiding, but elevating and ennobling, was reverence and obedience
to one wiser and better than ourselves.&nbsp; But that did not last.&nbsp;
It could not last.&nbsp; Our teacher was taken from us; perhaps by mere
change of place, and the chances of this mortal life; perhaps by death,
which sunders all fair bonds upon this side the grave.&nbsp; Perhaps,
most painful of all, we began to differ from our teacher; to find that,
though we respected and loved him still, though we felt a deep debt
of thanks to him for what he had taught us, we could not quite agree
in all; we had begun to think for ourselves, and we found that we must
think for ourselves; and the new responsibility was very heavy.&nbsp;
We felt like young birds thrust out of the nest to shift for themselves
in the wide world.</p>
<p>But, after a while, we found that we could think, could act for ourselves,
as we never expected to do.&nbsp; We found that we were no more children;
that we were improving in manly virtues by having to bear our own burdens;
and to acquire,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;The reason firm, the temperate will,<br />Endurance, foresight,
strength, and skill.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And we found, too, that though our old teachers were parted from
us, yet they were with us still; that (to compare small things with
great, and Christ&rsquo;s servants with their Lord) a spirit came to
us from them, and brought all things to our remembrance, whatsoever
they had said to us; that we remembered their words more vividly, we
understood their meaning more fully and deeply, now that they were parted,
than we did when they were with us.&nbsp; We loved them as well, ay,
better, than of old, for we saw more clearly what a debt we owed to
them; and so it was, after all, expedient for us that they should have
gone away.&nbsp; That parting with them, which seemed so dangerous to
us, as well as painful, really comforted us - strengthened and encouraged
us to become stronger and braver souls, full of self-help, self-government,
self-determination.</p>
<p>And so we shall find it, I believe, in our religion.</p>
<p>We may say with a sigh, &lsquo;Ah, that I could see my Lord and Saviour.&nbsp;
I should be safe then.&nbsp; I dare not sin then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It may be so.&nbsp; I am the last to deny that our Lord Jesus Christ
has (as he certainly could, if he chose) shown himself bodily to certain
of his saints (as he showed himself to St. Paul and to St. Stephen)
in order to strengthen their faith in some great trial.&nbsp; But if
it had been good for us in general to see the Lord in this life, doubt
not that we should have seen him.&nbsp; And because we do not see him,
be sure that it is not good.</p>
<p>We may say, again, &lsquo;Ah that the Lord Jesus had but remained
on earth, what just laws, what peace and prosperity would the world
have enjoyed!&nbsp; Wars would have ceased long ago; oppression and
injustice would be unknown.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It may be so.&nbsp; And yet again it may not.&nbsp; Perhaps our Lord&rsquo;s
staying on earth would have had some quite different effect, of which
we cannot even dream; and done, not good, but harm.&nbsp; Let us have
faith in him.&nbsp; Let us believe in his perfect wisdom, and in his
perfect love.&nbsp; Let us believe that he is educating us, as he educated
the apostles, by going away.&nbsp; That he is by his absence helping
men to help themselves, teaching men to teach themselves, guiding and
governing men to guide and govern themselves by that law of liberty
which is the law of his Spirit; to love the right, and to do the right,
not from fear of punishment, but of their own heart and will.</p>
<p>For remember, he has not left us comfortless.&nbsp; He has not merely
given us commands; he has given us the power of understanding, valuing,
obeying these commands.&nbsp; For his Spirit is with us; the Spirit
of Whitsuntide; the Comforter, the Encourager, the Strengthener, by
whom we may both perceive and know what we ought to do, and also have
grace and power faithfully to fulfil the same.</p>
<p>Come to yonder holy table this day, and there claim your share in
Christ, who is absent from you in the body, but ever present in the
spirit.&nbsp; Come to that table, that you may live by Christ&rsquo;s
life, and learn to love what he commandeth, and desire what he doth
promise, that so your hearts may surely there be fixed, where true joys
are to be found; namely, in the gracious motions and heavenly inspirations
of the Holy Ghost the Comforter, who proceedeth from the Father and
the Son.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXI. - ENDURANCE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I PETER ii. 19.</p>
<p>This is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief,
suffering wrongfully.</p>
<p>This is a great epistle, this epistle for the day, and full of deep
lessons.&nbsp; Let us try to learn some of them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What glory is it,&rsquo; St. Peter says, &lsquo;if, when ye
be beaten for your faults, ye take it patiently?&rsquo;&nbsp; What credit
is it to a man, if, having broken the law, he submits to be punished?&nbsp;
The man who will not do that, the man who resists punishment, is not
a civilized man, but a savage and a mere animal.&nbsp; If he will not
live under discipline, if he expects to break the law with impunity,
he makes himself an outlaw; he puts himself by his rebellion outside
the law, and becomes unfit for society, a public enemy of his fellow-men.&nbsp;
The first lesson which men have to learn, which even the heathen have
learnt, as soon as they have risen above mere savages, is the sacredness
of law - the necessity of punishment for those who break the law.</p>
<p>The Jews had this feeling of the sacredness of law.&nbsp; Moses&rsquo;
divine law had taught it them.&nbsp; The Romans, heathen though they
were, had the same feeling - that law was sacred; that men must obey
law.&nbsp; And the good thing which they did for the world (though they
did it at the expense of bloodshed and cruelty without end) was the
bringing all the lawless nations and wild tribes about them under strict
law, and drilling them into order and obedience.&nbsp; That it was,
which gave the Roman power strength and success for many centuries.</p>
<p>But above the kingdom of law, which says to a man merely, &lsquo;Thou
shalt not do wrong: and if thou dost, thou shalt be punished,&rsquo;
there is another kingdom, far deeper, wider, nobler; even the kingdom
of grace, which says to a man, not merely, &lsquo;Do not do wrong,&rsquo;
but &lsquo;Do right;&rsquo; and not only &lsquo;Do right for fear of
being punished,&rsquo; but &lsquo;Do right because it is right; do right
because thou hast grace in thy heart; even the grace of God, and the
Spirit of God, which makes thee love what is right, and see how right
it is, and how beautiful; so that thou must follow after the right,
not from fear of punishment, but in spite of fear of punishment; follow
after the right, not when it is safe only, but when it is dangerous;
not when it is honourable only in the eyes of men, but when it is despised.&nbsp;
If thou hast God&rsquo;s grace in thy heart; if thou lovest what is
right with the true love, which is the Spirit of God, then thou wilt
never stop to ask, &ldquo;Will it pay me to do right?&rdquo;&nbsp; Thou
wilt feel that the right thou must do, whether it pays thee or not;
still loving the right, and cleaving steadfastly to the right, through
disappointment, poverty, shame, trouble, death itself, if need be: if
only thou canst keep a conscience void of offence toward God and man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But shall I have no reward?&rsquo; asks a man, &lsquo;for
doing right?&nbsp; Am I to give up a hundred pleasant things for conscience&rsquo;
sake, and get nothing in return?&rsquo;&nbsp; Yes: there is a reward
for righteousness, even in this life.&nbsp; God repays those who make
sacrifices for conscience&rsquo; sake, I verily believe, in most cases,
a hundred fold in this life.&nbsp; In this life it stands true, that
he who loses his life shall save it; that he who goes through the world
with a single eye to duty, without selfishness, without vanity, without
ambition, careless whether he be laughed at, careless whether he be
ill-used, provided only his conscience acquits him, and God&rsquo;s
approving smile is on him - in this life it stands true that that man
is the happiest man after all; that that man is the most prosperous
man after all; that, like Christ, when he was doing his Father&rsquo;s
work, he has meat to eat and strengthen him in his life&rsquo;s journey,
which the world knows not of.&nbsp; But if not; if it seem good to God
to let him taste the bitters, and not the sweets, of doing right, in
this life; if it seem good to God that he should suffer - as many a
man and woman too has suffered for doing right - nothing but contempt,
neglect, prison, and death; is he worse off than Jesus Christ, his Lord,
was before him?&nbsp; Shall the disciple be above his master?&nbsp;
What if he have to drink of the cup of sorrow of which Christ drank,
and be baptized with the baptism of martyrdom with which Christ was
baptized?&nbsp; Where is he, but where the Son of God has been already?&nbsp;
What is he doing, but treading in the steps of Christ crucified; that
he may share in the blessing and glory and honour without end which
God the Father heaped upon Christ his Son, because he was perfect in
duty, perfect in love of right, perfect in resignation, perfect in submission
under injustice, perfect in forgiveness of his murderers, perfect in
faith in the justice and mercy of God: who did no sin - that is, never
injured his own cause by anger or revenge; and had no guile in his mouth
- that is, never prevaricated, lied, concealed his opinions, for fear
of the consequences, however terrible; but before the chief priests
and Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession, though he knew that
it would bring on him a dreadful death; who, when he was reviled, reviled
not again, but committed himself to him who judgeth righteously - the
meekest of all beings, and in that very meekness the strongest of all
beings; the most utterly resigned, and by that very resignation the
most heroic - the being who seemed, on the cross of Calvary, most utterly
conquered by injustice and violence: but who, by that very cross, conquered
the whole world.</p>
<p>This is a great mystery, and hard to learn.&nbsp; Flesh and blood,
our animal nature, will never compass it all; for it belongs, not to
the flesh, but to the spirit.&nbsp; But our spirits, our immortal souls,
may learn the lesson at last, if we feed them continually with the thought
of Christ; if we meditate upon whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
things are honourable, just, pure, lovely, and of good report.&nbsp;
Then we may learn, at last, after many failures, and many sorrows of
heart, that the spirit is stronger than the flesh; that meekness is
stronger than wrath, silence stronger than shouting, peace stronger
than war, forgiveness stronger than vengeance, just as Christ hanging
on his cross was stronger - exercising a more vast and miraculous effect
on the hearts of men - than if he had called whole armies of angels
to destroy his enemies, like one of the old kings and conquerors of
the earth, whose works have perished with themselves.</p>
<p>Yes, gradually we must learn that our strength is to sit still; that
to do well and suffer for it, instead of returning evil for evil, and
railing for railing, is to show forth the spirit of Christ, and to enter
into the joy of our Lord.</p>
<p>The statesman debating in Parliament; the conqueror changing the
fate of nations on bloody battle-fields; these all do their work; and
are needful, doubtless, in a sinful, piecemeal world like this.&nbsp;
But there are those of whom the noisy world never hears, who have chosen
the better part which shall not be taken from them; who enter into a
higher glory than that of statesmen, or conquerors, or the successful
and famous of the earth.&nbsp; Many a man - clergyman or layman - struggling
in poverty and obscurity, with daily toil of body and mind, to make
his fellow-creatures better and happier; many a poor woman, bearing
children in pain and sorrow, and bringing them up with pain and sorrow,
but in industry, too, and piety; or submitting without complaint to
a brutal husband; or sacrificing all her own hopes in life to feed and
educate her brothers and sisters; or enduring for years the peevishness
and troublesomeness of some relation; - all these (and the world which
God sees is full of such, though the world which man sees takes no note
of them) - gentle souls, humble souls, uncomplaining souls, suffering
souls, pious souls - these are God&rsquo;s elect; these are Christ&rsquo;s
sheep; these are the salt of the earth, who, by doing each their little
duty as unto God, not unto men, keep society from decaying more than
do all the constitutions and acts of parliament which statesmen ever
invented.&nbsp; These are they - though they little dream of any such
honour - who copy the likeness of the old martyrs, who did well and
suffered for it; and the likeness of Christ, of whom it was said, &lsquo;He
shall not strive nor cry, neither shall his voice be heard in the streets.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For what was it in the old martyrs which made men look up to them,
as persons infinitely better than themselves, with quite unmeasurable
admiration; so that they worshipped them after their deaths, as if they
had been gods rather than men?</p>
<p>It was this.&nbsp; The world in old times had been admiring successful
people, just as it does at this day.&nbsp; Was a man powerful, rich?&nbsp;
Had he slaves by the hundred?&nbsp; Was his table loaded with the richest
meats and wines?&nbsp; Could he indulge every pleasure and fancy of
his own?&nbsp; Could he heap his friends with benefits?&nbsp; Could
he ruin or destroy any one who thwarted him?&nbsp; In one word, was
he a mighty and successful tyrant?&nbsp; Then that was the man to honour
and worship; that was the sort of man to become, if anyone had the chance,
by fair means or foul.&nbsp; Just as the world worships now the successful
man; and - if you will but make a million of money - will flatter you
and court you, and never ask either how you made your money, or how
you spend your money; or whether you are a good man or a bad one: for
money in man&rsquo;s eyes, as charity in God&rsquo;s eyes, covereth
a multitude of sins; and as long as thou doest well unto thyself, men
will speak well of thee.</p>
<p>But there arose, in that wicked old world in which St. Paul lived,
an entirely new sort of people - people who did not wish to be successful;
did not wish to be rich; did not wish to be powerful; did not wish for
pleasures and luxuries which this world could give: who only wished
to be good; to do right, and to teach others to do right.&nbsp; Christians,
they were called; after Christ their Lord and God.&nbsp; Weak old men,
poor women, slaves, even children, were among them.&nbsp; Not many mighty,
not many rich, not many noble, were called.&nbsp; They were mostly weak
and oppressed people, who had been taught by suffering and sorrow.</p>
<p>One would have thought that the world would have despised these Christians,
and let them go their own way in peace.&nbsp; But it was not so.&nbsp;
The mighty of this world, and those who lived by pandering to their
vices, so far from despising the Christians, saw at once how important
they were.&nbsp; They saw that, if people went about the world determined
to speak nothing but what they believed to be true, and to do nothing
but what was right, then the wicked world would be indeed turned upside
down, and, as they complained against St. Paul more than once, the hope
of their gains would be gone.&nbsp; Therefore they conceived the most
bitter hatred against these Christians, and rose against them, for the
same simple reason that Cain rose up against Abel and slew him, because
his works were wicked, and his brother&rsquo;s righteous.&nbsp; They
argued with them; they threatened them; they tried to terrify them:
but they found to their astonishment that the Christians would not change
their minds for any terror.&nbsp; Then their hatred became rage and
fury.&nbsp; They could not understand how such poor ignorant contemptible
people as the Christians seemed to be, dared to have an opinion of their
own, and to stand to it; how they dared to think themselves right, and
all the world wrong; and in their fury they inflicted on them tortures
to read of which should make the blood run cold.&nbsp; And their rage
and fury increased to madness, when they found that these Christians,
instead of complaining, instead of rebelling, instead of trying to avenge
themselves, submitted to all their sufferings, not only patiently and
uncomplaining, but joyfully, and as an honour and a glory.&nbsp; Some,
no doubt, they conquered by torture, agony, and terror; and so made
them deny Christ, and return to the wickedness of the heathen.&nbsp;
But those renegades were always miserable.&nbsp; Their own consciences
condemned them.&nbsp; They felt they had sold their own souls for a
lie; and many of them, in their agony of mind, repented again, like
St. Peter after he had denied his Lord through fear, proclaimed themselves
Christians after all, went through all their tortures a second time,
and died triumphant over death and hell.</p>
<p>But there were those - to be counted by hundreds, if not thousands
- who dared all, and endured all; and won (as it was rightly called)
the crown of martyrdom.&nbsp; Feeble old men, weak women, poor slaves,
even little children, sealed their testimony with their blood, and conquered,
not by fighting, but by suffering.</p>
<p>They conquered.&nbsp; They conquered for themselves in the next world;
for they went to heaven and bliss, and their light affliction, which
was but for a moment, worked out for them an exceeding and eternal weight
of glory.</p>
<p>They conquered in this world also.&nbsp; For the very world which
had scourged them, racked them, crucified them, burned them alive, when
they were dead turned round and worshipped them as heroes, almost as
divine beings.&nbsp; And they were divine; for they had in them the
Divine Spirit, the Spirit of God and of Christ.&nbsp; Therefore the
foolish world was awed, conscience-stricken, pricked to the heart, when
it looked on those whom it had pierced, as it had pierced Christ the
Lord, and cried, as the centurion cried on Calvary, &lsquo;Surely these
were the sons and daughters of God.&nbsp; Surely there was some thing
more divine, more noble, more beautiful in these poor creatures dying
in torture, than in all the tyrants and conquerors and rich men of the
earth.&nbsp; This is the true greatness, this is the true heroism -
to do well and suffer for it patiently.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And thenceforth men began to get, slowly but surely, a quite new
idea of true greatness; they learnt to see that not revenge, but forgiveness;
not violence, but resignation; not success, but holiness, are the perfection
of humanity.&nbsp; They began to have a reverence for those who were
weak in body, and simple in heart, - a reverence for women, for children,
for slaves, for all whom the world despises, such as the old Egyptians,
Greeks, Romans, had never had.&nbsp; They began to see that God could
make strong the weak things of this world, and glorify himself in the
courage and honesty of the poorest and the meanest.&nbsp; They began
to see that in Christ Jesus was neither male nor female, Jew nor Greek,
barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but that all were one in Christ
Jesus, all alike capable of receiving the Spirit of God, all alike children
of the one Father, who was above all, and in all, and with them all.</p>
<p>And so the endurance and the sufferings of the early martyrs was
the triumph of good over evil; the triumph of honesty and truth; of
purity and virtue; of gentleness and patience; of faith in a just and
loving God: because it was the triumph of the Spirit of Christ, by which
he died, and rose again, and conquered shame and pain, and death and
hell.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXII. - TOLERATION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(<i>Preached at Christ Church, Marylebone</i>, 1867, <i>for the Bishop
of London&rsquo;s Fund</i>.)</p>
<p>MATTHEW xiii. 24-30.</p>
<p>The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed
in his field: but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among
the wheat, and went his way.&nbsp; But when the blade was sprung up,
and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.&nbsp; So the
servants of the household came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou
sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?&nbsp; He
said unto them, An enemy hath done this.&nbsp; The servants said unto
him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?&nbsp; But he said,
Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye toot up also the wheat with
them.&nbsp; Let both grow together until the harvest and in the time
of harvest: I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the
tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into
my barn.</p>
<p>The thoughtful man who wishes well to the Gospel of Christ will hardly
hear this parable without a feeling of humiliation.&nbsp; None of our
Lord&rsquo;s parables are more clear and simple in their meaning; none
have a more direct and practical command appended to them; none have
been less regarded during the last fifteen hundred years.&nbsp; Toleration,
solemnly enjoined, has been the exception.&nbsp; Persecution, solemnly
forbidden, has been the rule.&nbsp; Men, as usual, have fancied themselves
wiser than God; for they have believed themselves wise enough to do
what he had told them that they were not wise enough to do, and so have
tried to root the tares from among the wheat.&nbsp; Men have, as usual,
lacked faith in Christ; they did not believe that he was actually governing
the earth which belonged to him; that he was actually cultivating his
field, the world: they therefore believed themselves bound to do for
him what he neglected, or at least did not see fit, to do for himself;
and they tried to root up the tares from among the wheat.&nbsp; They
have tried to repress free thought, and to silence novel opinions, forgetful
that Christ must have been right after all, and that in silencing opinions
which startled them, they might be quenching the Spirit, and despising
prophecies.&nbsp; But they found it more difficult to quench the Spirit
than they fancied, when they began the policy of repression.&nbsp; They
have found that the Spirit blew where it listed, and they heard the
sound of it, but knew not whence it came, or whither it went; that the
utterances which startled them, the tones of feeling and thought which
terrified them, reappeared, though crushed in one place, suddenly in
another; that the whole atmosphere was charged with them, as with electricity;
and that it was impossible to say where the unseen force might not concentrate
itself at any moment, and flash out in a lightning stroke.&nbsp; Then
their fear has turned to a rage.&nbsp; They have thought no more of
putting down opinions: but of putting down men.&nbsp; They have found
it more difficult than they fancied to separate the man from his opinions;
to hate the sin and love the sinner: and so they have begun to persecute;
and, finding brute force, or at least the chichane of law, far more
easy than either convincing their opponents or allowing themselves to
be convinced by them, they have fined, imprisoned, tortured, burnt,
exterminated; and, like the Roman conquerors of old, &lsquo;made a desert,
and called that peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And all the while the words stood written in the Scriptures which
they professed to believe: &lsquo;Nay: lest while ye root up the tares,
ye root up the wheat also.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They had been told, if ever men were told, that the work was beyond
their powers of discernment: that, whatever the tares were, or however
they came into God&rsquo;s field the world, they were either too like
the wheat, or too intimately entangled with them, for any mortal man
to part them.&nbsp; God would part them in his own good time.&nbsp;
If they trusted God, they would let them be; certain that he hated what
was false, what was hurtful, infinitely more than they; certain that
he would some day cast out of his kingdom all things which offend, and
all that work injustice, and whatsoever loveth and maketh a lie; and
that, therefore, if he suffered such things to abide awhile, it was
for them to submit, and to believe that God loved the world better than
they, and knew better how to govern it.&nbsp; But if, on the contrary,
they did not believe God, then they would set to work, in their disobedient
self-conceit, to do that which he had forbidden them; and the certain
result would be that, with the tares, they would root up the wheat likewise.</p>
<p>Note here two things.&nbsp; First, it is not said that there were
no tares among the wheat; nor that the servants would fail in rooting
some of them up.&nbsp; They would succeed probably in doing some good:
but they would succeed certainly in doing more harm.&nbsp; In their
short-sighted, blind, erring, hasty zeal, they would destroy the good
with the evil.&nbsp; Their knowledge of this complex and miraculous
universe was too shallow, their canons of criticism were too narrow,
to decide on what ought, or ought not, to grow in the field of him whose
ways and thoughts were as much higher than theirs as the heaven is higher
than the earth.</p>
<p>Note also, that the Lord does not blame them for their purpose.&nbsp;
He merely points out to them its danger; and forbids it because it is
dangerous; for their wish to root out the tares was not &lsquo;natural.&rsquo;&nbsp;
We shall libel it by calling it that.&nbsp; It was distinctly spiritual,
the first impulse of spiritual men, who love right, and hate wrong,
and desire to cultivate the one, and exterminate the other.&nbsp; To
root out the tares; to put down bad men and wrong thoughts by force,
is one of the earliest religious instincts.&nbsp; It is the child&rsquo;s
instinct - pardonable though mistaken.&nbsp; The natural man - whether
the heathen savage at one end of the scale, or the epicurean man of
the world at the other - has no such instinct.&nbsp; He will feel no
anger against falsehood, because he has no love for truth; he will be
liberal enough, tolerant enough, of all which does not touch his own
self-interest; but that once threatened, he too may join the ranks of
the bigots, and persecute, not like them, in the name of God and truth,
but in those of society and order; and so the chief priests and Pontius
Pilate may make common cause.&nbsp; And yet the chief priests, with
their sense of duty, of truth, and of right, however blundering, concealed,
perverted, may be a whole moral heaven higher than Pilate with no sense
of aught beyond present expediency.&nbsp; But nevertheless what have
been the consequences to both?&nbsp; That the chief priests have failed
as utterly as the Pilates.&nbsp; As God forewarned them, they have rooted
up the wheat with the tares; they have made the blood of martyrs the
seed of the Church; and more, they have made martyrs of those who never
deserved to be martyrs, by wholesale and indiscriminate condemnation.&nbsp;
They have forgotten that the wheat and the tares grow together, not
merely in separate men, but in each man&rsquo;s own heart and thoughts;
that light and darkness, wisdom and folly, duty and ambition, self-sacrifice
and self-conceit, are fighting in every soul of man in whom there is
even the germ of spiritual life.&nbsp; Therefore they have made men
offenders for a word.&nbsp; They have despised noble aspirations, ignored
deep and sound insights, because they came in questionable shapes, mingled
with errors or eccentricities.&nbsp; They have cried in their haste,
&lsquo;Here are tares, and tares alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again and again have religious men done this, for many a hundred
years; and again and again the Nemesis has fallen on them.&nbsp; A generation
or two has passed, and the world has revolted from their unjust judgments.&nbsp;
It has perceived, among the evil, good which it had overlooked in an
indignant haste and passionateness, learnt from those who should have
taught it wisdom, patience, and charity.&nbsp; It has made heroes of
those who had been branded as heretics; and has cried, &lsquo;There
was wheat, and wheat alone;&rsquo; and so religious men have hindered
the very cause for which they fancied that they were fighting; and have
gained nothing by disobeying God&rsquo;s command, save to weaken their
own moral influence, to increase the divisions of the Church, and to
put a fresh stumbling-block in the path of the ignorant and the young.</p>
<p>And what have been the consequences to Christ&rsquo;s Church?&nbsp;
Have not her enemies - and her friends too - for centuries past, cried
in vain:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;For forms of faith let graceless zealots fight,<br />His can&rsquo;t
he wrong, whose life is in the right.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Of Christian morals her enemies have not complained: but that these
morals have been postponed, neglected, forgotten, in the disputes over
abstruse doctrines, over ceremonies, and over no-ceremonies; that men
who were all fully agreed in their definition of goodness, and what
a good man should be and do, have denounced each other concerning matters
which had no influence whatsoever to practical morality, till the ungodly
cried, &lsquo;See how these Christians hate one another!&nbsp; See how
they waste their time in disputing concerning the accidents of the bread
of life, forgetful that thousands were perishing round them for want
of any bread of life at all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>My friends, these things are true; and have been true for centuries.&nbsp;
Let us not try to forget them by denouncing them as the utterances of
the malevolent and the unbelieving.&nbsp; Let us rather imitate the
wise man who said, that he was always grateful to his critics, for,
however unjust their attacks, they were certain to attack, and therefore
to show him, his weakest points.&nbsp; And here is our weakest point;
namely, in our unhappy divisions - which are the fruits of self-will
and self-conceit, and of the vain attempt to do that which God incarnate
has told us we cannot do - to part the wheat from the tares.</p>
<p>We cannot part them.&nbsp; Man could never do it, even in the simpler
Middle Age.&nbsp; Far less can he do it now in an age full of such strange,
such complex influences; at once so progressive and conservative; an
age in which the same man is often craving after some new prospect of
the future, and craving at the same moment after the seemingly obsolete
past; longing for fresh truth, and yet dreading to lose the old; with
hope struggling against fear, courage against modesty, scorn of imbecility
against reverence for authority in the same man&rsquo;s heart, while
the mystery of the new world around him strives with the mystery of
the old world which lies behind him; while the belief that man is the
same being now as he was five thousand years ago strives with the plain
fact that he is assuming round us utterly novel habits, opinions, politics;
while the belief that Christ is the same now as he was in Jud&aelig;a
of old - yea, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever - strives with
the plain fact that his field, the world, is in a state in which it
never has been since the making of the world; while it is often most
difficult, though (as I believe) certainly possible, to see those divine
laws at work with which God governed the nations in old time.&nbsp;
May God forgive us all, both laity and clergy, every cruel word, every
uncharitable thought, every hasty judgment.&nbsp; Have we not need,
in such a time as this, of that divine humility which is the elder sister
of divine charity?&nbsp; Have we not need of some of that God-inspired
modesty of St. Paul&rsquo;s: &lsquo;I think as a child, I speak as a
child.&nbsp; I see through a glass darkly&rsquo;?&nbsp; Have we not
need to listen to his warning: &lsquo;he that regardeth the day, to
the Lord he regardeth it; and he that regardeth it not, to the Lord
he regardeth it not.&nbsp; Who art thou that judgest another?&nbsp;
To his own master he standeth or falleth.&nbsp; Yea, and he shall stand;
for God is able to make him stand&rsquo;?&nbsp; Have we not need to
hear our Lord&rsquo;s solemn rebuke, when St. John boasted how he saw
one casting out devils in Christ&rsquo;s name, and he forbade him, because
he followed not them - &lsquo;Forbid him not&rsquo;?&nbsp; Have we not
need to believe St. James, when he tells us that every good gift and
every perfect gift cometh from above, from the Father of lights, and
not (as we have too often fancied) sometimes from below, from darkness
and the pit?&nbsp; Have we not need to keep in mind the canon of the
wise Gamaliel? - &lsquo;If this counsel or this work be of man, it will
come to nought: but if it be of God, we cannot overthrow it, lest haply
we too be found fighting even against God.&rsquo;&nbsp; Have we not
need to keep in mind that &lsquo;every spirit which confesses that Jesus
Christ is come in the flesh is of God;&rsquo; and &lsquo;no man saith
that Jesus is the Christ, save by the Spirit of God;&rsquo; lest haply
we, too, be found more fastidious than Almighty God himself?&nbsp; Have
we not need to beware lest we, like the Scribes and Pharisees, should
be found keeping the key of knowledge, and yet not entering in ourselves,
and hindering those who would enter in?&nbsp; Have we not need to beware
lest, while we are settling which is the right gate to the kingdom of
heaven, the publicans and harlots should press into it before us; and
lest, while we are boasting that we are the children of Abraham, God
should, without our help, raise up children to Abraham of those stones
outside; those hard hearts, dull brains, natures ground down by the
drudgery of daily life till they are as the pavement of the streets;
those so-called &lsquo;heathen masses&rsquo; of whom we are bid to think
this day.</p>
<p>If there be any truth, any reason, in what I have said - or rather
in what Christ and his apostles have said - let us lay it to heart upon
this day, on which the clergy of this great metropolis have found a
common cause for which to plead, whatever may be their minor differences
of opinion.&nbsp; Let us wish success to every argument by which this
great cause may be enforced, to every scheme of good which may be built
up by its funds.&nbsp; Let us remember that, however much the sermons
preached this day differ in details, they will all agree, thank God,
in the root and ground of their pleading - duty to Christ, and to those
for whom Christ died.&nbsp; Let us remember that, to whatever outwardly
different purposes the money collected may be applied, it will after
all be applied to one purpose - to Christian civilization, Christian
teaching, Christian discipline; and that any Christianity, any Christian
civilization, any Christian discipline, is infinitely better than none;
that, though all man&rsquo;s systems and methods must be imperfect,
faulty, yet they are infinitely better than anarchy and heathendom,
just as the wheat, however much mixed with weeds, is infinitely better
than the weeds alone.&nbsp; But above all, let us wish well to all schemes
of education, of whatever kind, certain that any education is better
than none.&nbsp; And, therefore, let me entreat you to subscribe bountifully
to that scheme for which I specially plead this day.</p>
<p>Let me remind you, very solemnly, that the present dearth of education
in these realms is owing mainly to our unhappy religious dissensions;
that it is the disputes, not of unbelievers, but of Christians, which
have made it impossible for our government to fulfil one of the first
rights, one of the first duties, of any government in a civilized country;
namely, to command, and to compel, every child in the realm to receive
a proper education.&nbsp; Strange and sad that so it should be: yet
so it is.&nbsp; We have been letting, we are letting still, year by
year, thousands sink and drown in the slough of heathendom and brutality,
while we are debating learnedly whether a raft, or a boat, or a rope,
or a life-buoy, is the legitimate instrument for saving them; and future
historians will record with sorrow and wonder a fact which will be patent
to them, though the dust of controversy hides it from our eyes - even
the fact that the hinderers of education in these realms were to be
found, not among the so-called sceptics, not among the so-called infidels;
but among those who believed that God came down from heaven, and became
man, and died on the cross, for every savage child in London streets.&nbsp;
Compulsory government education is, by our own choice and determination,
impossible.&nbsp; The more solemn is the duty laid on us, on laity and
clergy alike, to supply that want by voluntary education.&nbsp; The
clergy will do their duty, each in his own way.&nbsp; Let the laity
do theirs likewise, in fear and trembling, as men who have voluntarily
and deliberately undertaken to educate the lower classes; and who must
do it, or bear the shame for ever.&nbsp; For in the last day, when we
shall all appear before Him whose ways are not as our ways, or his thoughts
as our thoughts - in that day, the question will not be, whether the
compulsory system, or the denominational system, or any other system,
satisfied best our sectarian ways and our narrow thoughts: but whether
they satisfied the ways of that Father in heaven who willeth not that
one little child should perish.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXIII. - THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>LUKE xix. 41.</p>
<p>And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it.</p>
<p>Let us think awhile what was meant by our Lord&rsquo;s weeping over
Jerusalem.&nbsp; We ought to learn thereby somewhat more of our Lord&rsquo;s
character, and of our Lord&rsquo;s government.</p>
<p>Why did he weep over that city whose people would, in a few days,
mock him, scourge him, crucify him, and so fill up the measure of their
own iniquity?&nbsp; Had Jesus been like too many, who since his time
have fancied themselves saints and prophets, would he not have rather
cursed the city than wept over it with tenderness, regret, sorrow, most
human and most divine, for that horrible destruction which before forty
years were past would sweep it off the face of the earth, and leave
not one stone of those glorious buildings on another?</p>
<p>The only answer is - that, in spite of all its sins, he loved Jerusalem.&nbsp;
For more than a thousand years, he had put his name there.&nbsp; It
was to be the salt of the earth, the light of the world, the city set
on a hill, which could not be hid.&nbsp; From Jerusalem was to go forth
to all nations the knowledge of the one true God, as a light to lighten
the Gentiles, as well as a glory to his people Israel.</p>
<p>This was our Lord&rsquo;s purpose; this had been his purpose for
one thousand years and more: and behold, man&rsquo;s sin and folly had
frustrated for a time the gracious will of God.&nbsp; That glorious
city, with its temple, its worship, its religion, true as far as it
went, and, in spite of all the traditions with which the Scribes and
Pharisees had overlaid it, infinitely better than the creed or religion
of any other people in the old world - all this, instead of being a
blessing to the world, had become a curse.&nbsp; The Jews, who had the
key of the knowledge of God, neither entered in themselves, nor let
the Gentiles enter in.&nbsp; They who were to have taught all the world
were hating and cursing all the world, and being hated and cursed by
them in return.&nbsp; Jerusalem, the Holy City set on a hill, instead
of being a light to the world, was become a nuisance to the world.&nbsp;
Jerusalem was the salt of the world, meant to help it all from decay;
but the salt had lost its savour, and in another generation it would
be cast out and trodden under foot, and become a byword among the Gentiles.</p>
<p>Our Lord, The Lord, the hereditary King of the Jews according to
the flesh, as well as the God of the Jews according to the Spirit, foresaw
the destruction of the work of his own hands, of the spot on earth which
was most precious to him.&nbsp; The ruin would be awful, the suffering
horrible.&nbsp; The daughters of Jerusalem were to weep, not for him,
but for themselves.&nbsp; Blessed would be the barren, and those that
never nursed a child.&nbsp; They would call on the mountains to cover
them, and on the hills to hide them, and call in vain.&nbsp; Such tribulation
would fall on them as never had been since the making of the world.&nbsp;
Mothers would eat their own children for famine.&nbsp; Three thousand
crosses would stand at one time in the valley below with a living man
writhing on each.&nbsp; Eleven hundred thousand souls would perish,
or be sold as slaves.&nbsp; It must be.&nbsp; The eternal laws of retribution,
according to which God governs the world, must have their way now.&nbsp;
It was too late.&nbsp; It must happen now.&nbsp; But it need not have
happened: and at that thought our Lord&rsquo;s infinite heart burst
forth in human tenderness, human pity, human love, as he looked on that
magnificent city, those gorgeous temples, castles, palaces, that mighty
multitude which dreamt so little of the awful doom which they were bringing
on themselves.</p>
<p>And now, where is he that wept over Jerusalem?&nbsp; Has he left
this world to itself?&nbsp; Does he care no longer for the rise and
fall of nations, the struggles and hopes, the successes and the failures
of mankind?</p>
<p>Not so, my friends.&nbsp; He has ascended up on high, and sat down
at the right hand of God: but he has done so, that he might fill all
things.&nbsp; To him all power is given in heaven and earth.&nbsp; He
reigneth over the nations.&nbsp; He sitteth on that throne whereof the
eternal Father hath said to him, &lsquo;Sit thou on my right hand until
I make thy foes thy footstool;&rsquo; and again, &lsquo;Desire of me,
and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the utmost
ends of the earth for thy possession.&rsquo;&nbsp; He is set upon his
throne (as St. John saw him in his Revelation) judging right, and ministering
true judgment unto the people.&nbsp; The nations may furiously rage
together, and the people may imagine a vain thing.&nbsp; The kings of
the earth may stand up, and the rulers take counsel together, against
the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, &lsquo;Let us break their
bonds&rsquo; - that is their laws, - &lsquo;asunder, and cast away their
cords&rsquo; - that is, their Gospel - &lsquo;from us.&rsquo;&nbsp;
They may say, &lsquo;Tush, God doth not see, neither doth God regard
it.&nbsp; We are they that ought to speak.&nbsp; Who is Lord over us?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Nevertheless Christ is King of kings, and Lord of lords; he reigns,
and will reign.&nbsp; And kings must be wise, and the judges of the
earth must be learned; they must serve the Lord in fear, and rejoice
before him with reverence.&nbsp; They must worship the Son, lest he
be angry, and so they perish from the right way.&nbsp; All the nations
of the world, with their kings and their people, their war, their trade,
their politics, and their arts and sciences, are in his hands as clay
in the hands of the potter, fulfilling his will and not their own, going
his way and not their own.&nbsp; It is he who speaks concerning a nation
or a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it.&nbsp;
And it is he again who speaks concerning a nation or kingdom, to build
and to plant it.&nbsp; For the Lord is king, be the world never so much
moved.&nbsp; He sitteth between the cherubim, though the earth be never
so unquiet.</p>
<p>But while we recollect this - which in these days almost all forget
- that Christ the Lord is the ruler, and he alone; we must recollect
likewise that he is not only a divine, but a human ruler.&nbsp; We must
recollect - oh, blessed thought! - that there is a Man in the midst
of the throne of heaven; that Christ has taken for ever the manhood
into God; and that all judgment is committed to him because he is the
Son of man, who can feel for men, and with men.</p>
<p>Yes, Christ&rsquo;s humanity is no less now than when he wept over
Jerusalem; and therefore we may believe, we must believe, that while
Jesus is very God of very God, yet his sacred heart is touched with
a divine compassion for the follies of men, a divine regret for their
failures, a divine pity for the ruin which they bring so often on themselves.&nbsp;
We must believe that even when he destroys, he does so with regret;
that when he cuts down the tree which cumbers the ground, he grieves
over it; as he grieved over his chosen vine, the nation of the Jews.</p>
<p>It is a comfort to remember this as we watch the world change, and
the fashions of it vanish away.&nbsp; Great kingdoms, venerable institutions,
gallant parties, which have done good work in their time upon God&rsquo;s
earth, grow old, wear out, lose their first love of what was just and
true; and know not the things which belong to their peace, but grow,
as the Jews grew in their latter years, more and more fanatical, quarrelsome,
peevish, uncharitable; trying to make up by violence for the loss of
strength and sincerity: till they come to an end, and die, often by
unjust and unfair means, and by men worse than they.&nbsp; Shall we
not believe that Christ has pity on them; that he who wept over Jerusalem
going to destruction by its own blindness, sorrows over the sins and
follies which bring shame on countries once prosperous, authorities
once venerable, causes once noble?</p>
<p>They, too, were thoughts of Christ.&nbsp; Whatsoever good was in
them, he inspired; whatsoever strength was in them, he gave; whatsoever
truth was in them, he taught; whatsoever good work they did, he did
through them.&nbsp; Perhaps he looks on them, not with wrath and indignation,
but with pity and sorrow, when he sees man&rsquo;s weakness, folly,
and sin, bringing to naught his gracious purposes, and falling short
of his glorious will.</p>
<p>It is a comfort, I say, to believe this, in these times of change.&nbsp;
Places, manners, opinions, institutions, change around us more and more;
and we are often sad, when we see good old fashions, in which we were
brought up, which we have loved, revered, looked on as sacred things,
dying out fast, and new fashions taking their places, which we cannot
love because we do not trust them, or even understand.&nbsp; The old
ways were good enough for us: why should they not be good enough for
our children after us?&nbsp; Therefore, we are sad at times, and the
young and the ambitious are apt to sneer at us, because we delight in
what is old rather than what is new.</p>
<p>Let us remember, then, that whatsoever changes, still there is one
who cannot change, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and for
ever.&nbsp; Surely he can feel for us, when he sees us regret old fashions
and old times; surely he does not look on our sadness as foolish, weak,
or sinful.&nbsp; It is pardonable, for it is human; and he has condescended
to feel it himself, when he wept over Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Only, he bids us not despair; not doubt his wisdom, his love, the
justice and beneficence of his rule.&nbsp; He ordereth all things in
heaven and earth; and, therefore, all things must, at last, go well.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;The old order changes, giving place to the new,<br />And God
fulfils himself in many ways,<br />Lest one good custom should corrupt
the world.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>We must believe that, and trust in Christ.&nbsp; We must trust in
him, that he will not cut down any tree in his garden until it actually
cumbers the ground, altogether unfruitful, and taking up room which
might be better used.&nbsp; We must trust him, that he will cast nothing
out of his kingdom till it actually offends, makes men stumble and fall
to their destruction.&nbsp; We must trust him, that he will do away
with nothing that is old, without putting something better in its place.&nbsp;
Thus we shall keep up our hearts, though things do change round us,
sometimes mournfully enough.&nbsp; For Christ destroyed Jerusalem.&nbsp;
But, again, its destruction was, as St. Paul said, life to all nations.&nbsp;
He destroyed Moses&rsquo; law.&nbsp; But he, by so doing, put in its
place his own Gospel.&nbsp; He scattered abroad the nations of the Jews,
but he thereby called into his Church all nations of the earth.&nbsp;
He destroyed, with a fearful destruction, the Holy City and temple,
over which he wept.&nbsp; But he did so in order that the Holy City,
the New Jerusalem, even his Church, should come down from heaven; needing
no temple, for he himself is the temple thereof; that the nations of
those which were saved should walk in the light of it; and that the
river of the water of life should flow from the throne of God; and that
the leaves of the trees which grew thereby should be for the healing
of the nations.&nbsp; In that magnificent imagery, St. John shows us
how the most terrible destruction which the Lord ever brought upon a
holy place and holy institutions was really a blessing to all the world.&nbsp;
Let us believe that it has been so often since; that it will be so often
again.&nbsp; Let us look forward to the future with hope and faith,
even while we look back on the past with love and regret.&nbsp; Let
us leave unmanly and unchristian fears to those who fancy that Christ
has deserted his kingdom, and has left them to govern it in his stead;
and who naturally break out into peevishness and terrified lamentations,
when they discover that the world will not go their way, or any man&rsquo;s
way, because it is going the way of God, whose ways are not as man&rsquo;s
ways nor his thoughts as man&rsquo;s thoughts.&nbsp; Let us have faith
in God and in Christ, amid all the chances and changes of this mortal
life; and believe that he is leading the world and mankind to</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;One far-off divine event<br />Toward which
the whole creation moves;&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and possess our souls in patience, and in faith, and in hope for
ourselves and for our children after; while we say, with the Psalmist
of old: &lsquo;Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundations
of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands.&nbsp; They
shall perish, but thou shalt endure.&nbsp; They all shall wax old as
doth a garment; and as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall
be cleansed.&nbsp; But thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.&nbsp;
The children of thy servants shall continue; and their seed shall stand
fast in thy sight.&rsquo;&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<h2>SERMON XXIV. - THE LIKENESS OF GOD</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>EPHESIANS iv. 23, 24.</p>
<p>And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and that ye put on the
new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.</p>
<p>Be renewed, says St. Paul, in the spirit of your mind - in the tone,
character, and habit of your mind.&nbsp; And put on the new man, the
new pattern of man, who was created after God, in righteousness and
true holiness.</p>
<p>Pay attention, I beg you, to every word here.&nbsp; To understand
them clearly is most important to you.&nbsp; According as you take them
rightly or wrongly, will your religion be healthy or unhealthy, and
your notion of what God requires of you true or false.&nbsp; The new
man, the new pattern of man, says St. Paul, is created after God.&nbsp;
That, is after the pattern of God, in the image of God, in the likeness
of God.&nbsp; You will surely see that that is his meaning.&nbsp; We
speak of making a thing after another thing; meaning, make it exactly
like another thing.&nbsp; So, by making a man after God, St. Paul means
making a man like God.</p>
<p>Now what is this man?&nbsp; None, be sure, save Christ himself, the
co-equal and co-eternal Son of God.&nbsp; Of him alone can it be said,
utterly, that he is after God - the brightness of God&rsquo;s glory,
and the express image of his person.&nbsp; But still, he is a man, and
meant as a pattern to men; the new Adam; the new pattern, type, and
ideal for all mankind.&nbsp; Him, says St. Paul, - that is, his likeness,
- we are to put on, that as he was after the likeness of God, so may
we be likewise.</p>
<p>But now, in what does this same likeness consist?</p>
<p>St. Paul tells us distinctly, lest we should mistake a matter of
such boundless importance as the question of all questions - What is
the life of God, the Divine and Godlike life?</p>
<p>It is created, founded, says he, in righteousness and true holiness.&nbsp;
That is the character, that is the form of it.&nbsp; Whatever we do
not know, whatever we cannot know, concerning God, and his Divine life,
we know that it consists of righteousness and true holiness.</p>
<p>And what is righteousness?&nbsp; Justice.&nbsp; You must understand
- as any good scholar or divine would assure you - that St. Paul is
not speaking here of the imputed righteousness of Christ.&nbsp; He is
speaking of righteousness in the simple Old Testament meaning of the
word, of justice, whereof our Lord has said, &lsquo;Do unto others as
ye would they should do unto you;&rsquo; justice, which, as wise men
of old have said, consists in this, - to harm no man, and to give each
man his own.&nbsp; That is true righteousness and justice, and that
is the Godlike life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And true holiness.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is, truthful holiness,
honest holiness.&nbsp; This is St. Paul&rsquo;s meaning.&nbsp; As any
good scholar or divine would tell you, St. Paul&rsquo;s exact words
are &lsquo;the holiness of truth.&rsquo;&nbsp; He does not mean true
holiness as opposed to a false holiness, a legal holiness, a holiness
of empty forms and ceremonies, or a holiness of ascetism and celibacy;
but as opposed to a holiness which does not speak the truth, to that
sly, untruthful, prevaricating holiness which was only too common in
St. Paul&rsquo;s time, and has been but too common since.&nbsp; Be honest,
says St. Paul; for this too is part of the Godlike life, and the new
man is created after God, in justice and honesty.</p>
<p>And that this is what St. Paul actually means is clear from what
immediately follows: &lsquo;Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every
man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What does the &lsquo;wherefore&rsquo; mean, if not that, because
the life of God is a life of justice and honesty, therefore you must
not lie; therefore you must not hear spite and malice; therefore you
must not steal, but rather work; therefore you must avoid all foul talk
which may injure your neighbour; but rather teach, refine, educate him?</p>
<p>It would seem at first sight that this would have been a gospel,
and good news to men.&nbsp; But, alas! it has not been such.&nbsp; In
all ages, in all religions, men have turned away from this simple righteousness
of God, which is created in justice and truth, and have sought some
righteousness of their own, founded upon anything and everything save
common morality and honesty.&nbsp; Alas for the spiritual pride of man!&nbsp;
He is not content to be simply just and true! for any one and every
one, he thinks, can be that.&nbsp; He must needs be something, which
other people cannot be.&nbsp; He must needs be able to thank God that
he is not as other men are, and say, &lsquo;This people, this wicked
world, who knoweth not our law, is accursed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If God had bid men do some great thing to save their souls, would
they not have done it?&nbsp; How much more when he says simply to them,
as to Naaman, &lsquo;Wash, and be clean.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Wash you,&rsquo;
says the Lord by the prophet Isaiah, &lsquo;make you clean.&nbsp; Put
away the evil of your doings from before my eyes.&nbsp; Cease to do
evil.&nbsp; Learn to do well, seek justice, relieve the oppressed,&rsquo;
and then, &lsquo;though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white
as snow.&rsquo;&nbsp; But no: any one can do that; and therefore it
is beneath the spiritual pride of man.&nbsp; In our own days, there
are too many who do not hesitate to look down on plain justice, and
plain honesty, as natural virtues, which (so they say) men can have
without the grace of God, and make a distinction between these natural
virtues and the effects of God&rsquo;s Spirit; which is not only not
to be found in Scripture, but is contradicted by Scripture from beginning
to end.</p>
<p>Now there can be no doubt that such notions concerning religion do
harm; that they demoralise thousands, - that is, make them less moral
and good men.&nbsp; For there are thousands, especially in England,
who are persons of good common-sense, uprightness, and truthfulness:
but they have not lively fancies, or quick feelings.&nbsp; They have
no inclination for a life of exclusive devoutness; and if they had,
they have no time for it.&nbsp; They must do their business in the world
where God has put them.&nbsp; And when they are told that God requires
of them certain frames and feelings, and that the Godlike life consists
in them, then they are disheartened, and say, &lsquo;There is no use,
then, in my trying to be religious, or moral either.&nbsp; If plain
honesty, justice, sobriety, usefulness in my place will not please God,
I cannot please him at all.&nbsp; Why then should I try, if my way of
trying is of no use?&nbsp; Why should I try to be honest, sober, and
useful, if that is not true religion? - if what God wants of me is not
virtue, but a certain high-flown religiousness which I cannot feel or
even understand?&rsquo; - and so they grow weary in well-doing, and
careless about the plain duties of morality.&nbsp; They become careless,
likewise, about the plain duties of religion; and so they are demoralised,
because they are told that justice and the holiness of truth are not
the Godlike and eternal life; because they are told that religion has
little or nothing to do with their daily life and business, nothing
to do with those just and truthful instincts of their hearts, which
they feel to be the most sacred things about them; which are their best,
if not their only guide in life.&nbsp; But more: they fall into the
mistake that they can have a righteousness of their own; and into that
Pelagianism, as it is called, which is growing more and more the creed
of modern men of the world.</p>
<p>Too many religious people, on the other hand, are demoralised by
the very same notion.</p>
<p>They too are taught that justice and truth are mere &lsquo;morality,&rsquo;
as it is called, and not the grace of God; that they are not the foundation
of the Divine life, that they are not the essence of true religion.&nbsp;
Therefore they become more and more careless about mere morality, -
so careless of justice, so careless of truth, as to bring often fearful
scandals on religion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile men in general, especially Englishmen, have a very sound
instinct on this whole matter.&nbsp; They have a sound instinct that
if God be good, then goodness is the only true mark of godliness; and
that goodness consists first and foremost in plain justice and plain
honesty; and they ask, not what a man&rsquo;s religious profession is,
not what his religious observances are: but - &lsquo;What is the man
himself?&nbsp; Is he a just, upright, and fair-dealing man?&nbsp; Is
he true?&nbsp; Can we depend on his word?&rsquo;&nbsp; If not, his religion
counts for nothing with them: as it ought to count.</p>
<p>Now I hold that St. Paul in this text declares that the plain English
folk who talk thus, and who are too often called mere worldlings, and
men of the world, are right; that justice and honesty are the Divine
life itself, and the very likeness of Christ and of God.</p>
<p>Justice and truth all men can have, and therefore all men are required
to have.&nbsp; About devotional feelings, about religious observances,
however excellent and blessed, we may deceive ourselves; for we may
put them in the place of sanctification, of righteousness and true holiness.&nbsp;
About justice and honesty we cannot deceive ourselves; for they are
sanctification itself, righteousness itself, true holiness itself, the
very likeness of God, and the very grace of God.</p>
<p>But if so, they come from God; they are God&rsquo;s gift, and not
any natural product of our own hearts: and for that very reason we can
and must keep them alive in us by prayer.&nbsp; As long as we think
that the sentiment of justice and truth is our own, so long shall we
be in danger of forgetting it, paltering with it, playing false to it
in temptation, and by some injustice or meanness grieving (as St. Paul
warns us) the Holy Spirit of God, who has inspired us with that priceless
treasure.</p>
<p>But if we believe that from God, the fount of justice, comes all
our justice; that from God, the fount of truth, comes all our truthfulness,
then we shall cry earnestly to him, day by day, as we go about this
world&rsquo;s work, to be kept from all injustice, and from all falsehood.&nbsp;
We shall entreat him to cleanse us from our secret faults, and to give
us truth in the inward parts; to pour into our hearts that love to our
neighbour which is justice itself, for it worketh no ill to its neighbour,
and so fulfils the law.&nbsp; We shall dread all meanness and cruelty,
as sins against the very Spirit of God; and our most earnest and solemn
endeavour in life will be, to keep innocence, and take heed to the thing
that is right; for that will bring us peace at the last.</p>

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,

We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones
that have responded.

As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
PMB 113
1739 University Ave.
Oxford, MS 38655-4109

Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment
method other than by check or money order.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by
the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.

We need your donations more than ever!

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the

     if you wish, distribute this eBook in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,

     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          eBook in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
